# Example on how to make a soundeffect to add in game
#######################################

# First of all make a sound so that the game can find the location of the file
# Then make a soundeffect, in there you can change a bunch of things, to know more visit https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Sound_modding
# Finally add in the event/focus/decision, sound_effect = "sound_test_2" (sound_effect is global) 
# or scoped_sound_effect = "sound_test_2" (scoped_sound_effect is for the current scope)
# Remember that the files must be .wav

#sound = {
#	name = "sound_test"
#	file = "sound_effects/musicfile.wav"
#	always_load = yes
#}

#soundeffect = {
#	name = sound_test_2
#	volume = 1
#	sounds = {
#		sound = sound_test
#	} 
#}
