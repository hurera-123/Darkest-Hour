 JAP_4th_Fleet_Exercise.1.t: "Fourth Fleet Caught in Foul Weather"
 JAP_4th_Fleet_Exercise.1.d: "The Fourth Fleet had not touched water in many years when it was brought back to participate in a war game exercise. The Fleet was expected to perform well and to hold its own on the high seas under the capable leadership of Hajime Matsushita.\n\nHowever, tragedy struck the old Fleet when it was caught in extremely bad weather while performing field manoeuvres. Officers and engineers were immediately dispatched to assess the Fleet's damage, which was found to be far greater than expected.\n\nReports indicate that the submarines and the cruisers have suffered serious cracks in their hulls, and that the carriers have suffered extensive damage to their flight decks and superstructures. However, it appears that the fleet's destroyers have fared the worst, with nearly all of them suffering damage to their superstructures and losing crew.\n\nSoon after, a hearing on the incident was held, and several recommendations were made to ensure that such a tragedy never happens again. These recommendations have been sent to the admiralty and ship manufacturers in [JAP.GetName], and it is expected that ship quality will improve significantly in the coming years. It remains to be seen how long it will take to repair the Fourth Fleet's damage as a result of this unfortunate turn of events."
 JAP_4th_Fleet_Exercise.1.A: "Every tragedy is an opportunity to better ourselves."

 JAP_Flavor.1.t: "The Lytton Report"
 JAP_Flavor.1.d: "The League of Nations has published a report today concerning us and our actions in Manchuria. This Lytton Report is a paper on the findings of the Lytton Commission, a five-member commission headed by British politician The Earl of Lytton meant to evaluate the Mukden Incident, the event which led to our nation’s seizure of Manchuria. \n\nThe group spent six weeks in Manchuria in spring 1932 (despite having been sent in December 1931) on a fact-finding mission after they had met government leaders in the Republic of China and in Japan. Regarding Manchukuo, the Report concluded that the new State could not have been formed without the presence of Japanese troops; that it had no general Chinese support; and that it was not part of a genuine and spontaneous independent movement. \n\nClearly, this report is a blatant attack on Japan and our allies in Asia. They claim that our grievances were legitimate, but then turn and claim our actions to rectify the situation were not? China was never going to give us our rightful reparations for the disrespect they earned when they bombed our railway at Mukden. It was not only our right, but our prerogative to move into Manchuria and rectify the situation. In light of how the League of Nations has seemingly turned against us on this issue, perhaps we should move to review our participation in the organization as a whole."
 JAP_Flavor.1.A: "Yet more international bias against Japan."

 JAP_Flavor.2.t: "Our Withdrawal from the League of Nations"
 JAP_Flavor.2.t.GER: "Japan Defies the League and Walks Out."
 JAP_Flavor.2.t.ALL: "Japan Withdraws from the League of Nations"
 JAP_Flavor.2.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]The gall of an organization like the League of Nations to criticize our actions in Asia with their Lytton Report, while so blatantly pandering to imperialistic Western empires like Britain or France is the pinnacle of hypocrisy, and quite frankly revolting. There are millions of Africans, Indians, and Southeast Asians under foreign dominion that have never seen the fruits of their so-called democracies. \n\nYet when a nation in the East begins to assert itself on the world stage, they draw up such insulting documents like the Lytton report, and propose sanctions on us. No more. Our entire delegation to the League walked out of the Assembly Hall, heads held high. \n\nEffective immediately, Japan will no longer be a part of the League of Nations. With our having already sent in the proper documentation to notify the organization of our withdrawal, we will no longer be restricted by that petty eurocentric regulatory pushover. \n\nWhat’s in motion now has already been set in motion. If they pursue sanctions over Manchuria, it will be just as if we had not joined the organization to begin with. Thus, there is no need to maintain the facade any longer. We will no longer constrain ourselves in fear of international retribution. Our actions in Asia have only strengthened us. To steer from this course now would be to deny our destiny as a world power."
 JAP_Flavor.2.d.GER: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]The Imperial State of Japan delivered today a message to Geneva announcing its intentions to withdraw from the League of Nations. Citing the appointment of the Lytton Commission, a committee assembled to evaluate the Mukden incident and the legality of Japan’s invasion of China, and various condemnations of Japan’s expansion in Asia, Japan argued that an anti-Japanese sentiment existed within the League, and that the only logical course of action was to leave.\n\nAnd leave they did. They entire Japanese delegation followed their chief diplomat, right out of the Assembly Hall, stunning the entire room and the world. \n\nThe League, already considered by some to be an ineffectual organization without the backing of the United States, now finds itself on ever more tenuous ground. Other important members of the organization, such as Italy and Germany, have also indicated an opposition to many of the League’s goals and actions and are reportedly at risk of withdrawing themselves. \n\nInternational observers have commented that should the League fail to apply appropriate retaliatory measures for Japan’s violation of international law as determined by the Lytton Commission, it will only embolden others to follow in Japan’s footsteps. With the League’s credibility on the line, rapid action may be necessary to keep it from failing completely."

In exchange for their support, the government has agreed to redirect some funds originally intended for the Army to the Navy. This would not be necessary in any normal country. In a normal country, the Army and Navy would be more capable of cooperating and would not demand that one be defunded in order to fund the other. However, Japan is not a typical country.

 # Foreign Policy
 JAP_Foreign_Policy.1.t: "A Common Goal..."
 JAP_Foreign_Policy.1.d: "With the recent results of the Lytton Report and our subsequent exodus from the League of Nations, our position has become a tenuous one. Our actions in Manchuria, though it led to a great gain for our empire, has now also opened ourselves to inevitable border contacts with both China and the Soviet Union. Considering the reaction the United States to our actions, we must also be wary of western interventions should chose to push our gains further into either China or the USSR. The Foreign Ministry must navigate cautiously with our diplomatic agendas to decide how we should proceed in this situation. Currently, there are three potential candidates for our foreign efforts each with their own diplomatic agendas: Hirota, Shidehara, Matsuoka."
 JAP_Foreign_Policy.1.A: "Let us see what each will provide."
 
 JAP_Foreign_Policy.2.t: "The Great Compromiser"
 JAP_Foreign_Policy.2.d: "Hirota's agenda is one that prioritizes against communism spreading throughout East Asia. His proposal is to cease the continued antagonization against China in an effort to cooperate with the Chinese government and to form a bloc against the continual communist influence in East Asia. He believes that China is a crucial part of East Asian stability and that, if necessary, Japan should intervene in preserving said stability as a effort against the expansion of the Soviet Union. He argues that Japan should reach an agreement with the Chinese government on this front and seek further cooperation, even if it means the utilization Japanese Arms."
 JAP_Foreign_Policy.2.A: "It would be a bold move."
 
 JAP_Foreign_Policy.3.t: "A Gentle Touch"
 JAP_Foreign_Policy.3.d: "Shidehara's agenda is one of peaceful and reconciliation. His belief is that Japan should take a non-intervening policy towards China, one of reconciliation with the Chinese Government. This, however, would be quite an effort considering our actions in Manchuria has practically broke this doctrine, making amends might be necessary. However this does not mean that Japan would cease to expand its influence, it simply switched to a touch of soft power instead of the hard military expansion. Shidehara's agenda is to expand with the power of the economy, influencing countries to strike accords in favour of Japan."
 JAP_Foreign_Policy.3.A: "Peace must surely be considered."
 
 JAP_Foreign_Policy.4.t: "Matter over Mind"
 JAP_Foreign_Policy.4.d: "Matsuoka’s agenda is one of expansion and deterrence. He believes that Japan would benefit the most by cooperating with Italy and Germany. He believes that with Germany and Italy, Japan would stand a foot on the international front against the forces of both the Soviet Union and the Western Powers. He believes that Japan’s rise to a great power must come at the defeat of these Powers and war with them is inevitable. He also believes in strong interventionism in China and the use of strong arm diplomacy."

 JAP_Foreign_Policy.5.t: "...With Different Methods"
 JAP_Foreign_Policy.5.d: "Our course of diplomatic action depends on which candidate we decide to choose, as each has a different vision for Japan’s position in the world, and each has its reasons and theories. Beware, however, that should our diplomacy have become too extreme, our already precarious international standing would be even worse, which has the potential backlash of harming our economy and worsening our relations with some of the major powers of the world. Now the question arises: who would be our candidate for our foreign policy?"

 # Aizawa Incident
 JAP_Aizawa_Incident.1.t: "A Plot Unraveled"
 JAP_Aizawa_Incident.1.d: "Captain Tsuji Masanobu was in shock. He had always had a dislike for the Kodoha, their rhetoric was a bit too aggressive, even for him. All that talk of creating a new military government to secure Japan once and for all put him off from the organization. But to organize a coup against the government? It was more than mere conjecture, it was treason! And in the Imperial Japanese Army Academy no less.\n\n“Sir?”, Cadet Sato asked, a worried look on his face.\n\nThe captain’s head snapped back towards his cadet, apparently broken from his brief trance.\n\n“Thank you for the information, cadet. The situation will be dealt with shortly. You are dismissed.” \n\nThe captain fell back into his seat as his cadet left the room. According to his cadet, there were only seven of them, five cadets and two officers. Theoretically, he could handle the matter himself. However, if these other reports about a secret ultranationalist organization called “The Sakurakai” are to be believed, it’s possible this conspiracy goes even further beyond what the cadet was aware of. \n\nNo, this matter was too grave to be handled alone. The captain wiped his face briefly before turning his gaze to the telephone on his desk. The authorities needed to know about this threat immediately. Captain Tsuji Masanobu picked up the receiver to his telephone and started dialing."
 JAP_Aizawa_Incident.1.A: "“Get me the Major General of the Kempeitai.”"

 JAP_Aizawa_Incident.2.t: "A Disgraced Genius"
 JAP_Aizawa_Incident.2.d: "Jinzaburō Masaki looked at the resignation in front of him with anger. It was ridiculous! Absolutely unbelievable! All he had done to climb the ranks of the military, to serve his country, only to be discarded like this? He had fought in the Russo-Japanese war. He had graduated from the military college top of his class. He had clawed his way up the military ranks at a blistering rate, from an entry level second lieutenant on the front lines to a three-star lieutenant general, a climb that was almost unheard of considering his background. He performed his duties as Inspector-General of Military Education excellently.\n\nAnd yet, Masaki knew this was the end of his career. Someone had to take the fall for allowing the coup to have progressed as far as it did, and he was the perfect scapegoat. If it wasn’t bad enough he had been in charge of military education, and the coup had been plotted from within the Imperial Japanese Army Academy, he had also been associated with the Kodoha faction for years, the political faction from where the plot originated. All his hard work undone by a few foolhardy students playing general! \n\nThe aging general suddenly felt very weary. Perhaps it was best his climb to the top was at an end. He had lost his appetite for war long ago. Serving in Manchuria against the Russians had ensured that distaste. Additionally, his successor, Major General Tetsuzan Nagata, seemed competent enough to take over after him. There was naught much else for him to do now anyways. The general slowly turned his eyes back to the resignation in front of him, and picked up a pen."
 JAP_Aizawa_Incident.2.A: "\"I, Jinzaburō Masaki, tender my resignation...\""

 JAP_Aizawa_Incident.3.t: "Restoration of Military Discipline"
 JAP_Aizawa_Incident.3.d: "Tokyo may have avoided a looming crisis this week as a group of radical Kodoha-aligned students and officers have gone to trial for planning a coup. While none of the conspirators will face criminal charges due to lack of solid evidence, the report of Cadet Sato proved worrying enough for the Army War College to expel five cadets. Two junior officers implicated with the plot, Lieutenant Colonel Muranaka and Lieutenant Isobe, were also suspended from military service.\n\nWith Kodoha attempts to minimize the connection between themselves and the plotters falling on deaf ears, many government and military officials associated with the faction have been replaced, among them Major General Jinzaburō Masaki, Inspector-General of Military Education.\n\nMasaki’s successor, the more moderate Major General Tetsuzan Nagata, has signaled his intention to root out treasonous organizations that Masaki either allowed through inaction or perhaps even directly supported."
 JAP_Aizawa_Incident.3.A: "Thank goodness."

 JAP_Aizawa_Incident.4.t: "The Brave Man's Song"
 JAP_Aizawa_Incident.4.d: "The man arrived in downtown Tokyo early in the morning. He’d always enjoyed the city, even if he was more accustomed to his more rural home up north. He immersed himself in the mass of humanity around him- the sights, the sounds, and the smells of the city made him feel alive. \n\nThe man had no time to enjoy such things today. He had a mission to fulfill. To an outside observer, it might seem strange that a man would wear something so large and heavy as an overcoat on a day as bright and temperate as this one was. After all, it was spring, the most beautiful time of the year in Tokyo. One seldom assumes what such coat may conceal beneath its folds. \n\nIt didn’t take long for him to arrive at his destination- an old, drab government building whose grey concrete had grown increasingly worn over the years. It was at this point that the man noticed just how heavy he felt. It wasn’t just what he was carrying, though that too felt strangely heavy, but a sense of dread. It felt like a warning. As if he shouldn’t be doing this. However, he knew it was too late now. His military career was over, his life gone- this would be his final destination. \n\nSecurity was lax as he walked in. Just a few weary desk jockeys languishing under an endless pile of paperwork and some bored-looking guards off to the side. When he asked the way to Tetsuzan Nagata’s office, they just pointed down the hall. Strangely, so close to his destination, he noticed that he had suddenly ceased to feel anything. It was as though nothing mattered to him anymore. He felt spiritually balanced in a way as he walked into the office and closed the door behind him. Nagata had hardly enough time to lift his head before the man’s concealed weapon came out, a sword gleaming in the sunlight streaming into the room, and further, hardly enough time to widen his eyes before the blade came down."
 JAP_Aizawa_Incident.4.A: "A few seconds is all it takes."

 JAP_Aizawa_Incident.5.t: "The Dark Genius"
 JAP_Aizawa_Incident.5.d: "When news of the attempted coup had come to light in the Japanese diet, there was at first confusion and then outrage. How could the Kodoha, even an isolated cell of that faction, consider overthrowing the government? Had they no love for their country? Yet none were more confused or more outraged than the Kodoha themselves. \n\nMany within the Kodoha Faction believe that Cadet Sato, the former conspirator who informed authorities of the plot, had been a spy for Captain Tsuji all along- and that the affair was a Tōseiha scheme to discredit Inspector-General of Military Education General Jinzaburō Masaki. The choice of his replacement, Tōseiha-aligned General Watanabe Jotaro, seemed to confirm Kodoha suspicions, giving rise to calls for vengeance from within their ranks.\n\nWith inter-factional tensions at a high point, lieutenant colonel Saburō Aizawa further escalated the crisis, deciding to avenge the honor of both the Kodoha and Masaki by murdering Nagata in his office. Aizawa's actions may also have been motivated by doctrinal disputes between himself and Nagata, whose national mobilization strategy he found deeply offensive. Until his untimely death, Nagata had advocated preparing both the military and civilian economy for total war, which Aizawa perceived as collusion with corrupt party politics and the zaibatsu. \n\nAizawa may have achieved his perceived justice by killing Nagata, but in doing so, he has discredited the Kodoha Faction more than the Tōseiha ever could. With the whole nation mourning Nagata's death, What little influence the Kodoha still hold is quickly slipping away."
 JAP_Aizawa_Incident.5.A: "The Kodoha Faction hangs by a thread."
 
 JAP_Aizawa_Incident.6.t: "One's Devotions, One's Duty"
 JAP_Aizawa_Incident.6.d: "Our current War Minister, Sadao Araki, has just resigned. This is a great set back for sympathisers of the Kodoha movement as he is the primary founder of said movement. Adding up to the recent increased tensions with the Toseiha faction after the Manchurian incidents, the Kodoha movement is in a precarious situation: if a Toseiha War Minister takes office, the Toseiha could have  power to directly undermine the Kodoha faction by reassigning the officers who are sympathetic to the Kodoha cause. This might be a seismic shift for our military’s involvement in politics."
 JAP_Aizawa_Incident.6.A: "Time to pass the torch to the younger men."
 JAP_Aizawa_Incident.6.B: "My duty will sustain me."

 # Teijin Incident - End of Saito Cabinet
 JAP_Teijin_Incident.1.t: "The Raging Bull of Taihoku"
 JAP_Teijin_Incident.1.d: "Despite the fervent economic downturn that has plagued the rest of the globe, Japan has soldiered on, literally. In 1932 alone, the Empire’s GDP grew by an astonishing 5%, fueled by the continued militarization and new conquests in Manchuria. The more Nippon takes, the more opportunities arise for making a quick couple thousand yen.\n\nTaihoku Prefecture, originally known as the island of Formosa, has been a part of the Empire since 1895 after the Sino-Japanese Conflict. A constant process of integration, Taihoku is considered the model colony of the empire, an extension of the Home Islands. So much so, the Bank of Taiwan regularly maintains stock listings for the Kabushiki Torihikijo, the exchange in metropolitan Tokyo. The ticker tape never stops. \n\nJust this morning, a group of young investors made a substantial purchase of 100,000 shares of Teijin Limited, a leading textile firm. Savvy stockholders that they are, this group, known as the Banchokai, now have a firm entrance into the Rayon industry within Nippon. And at only ¥125 per share, a potential profit is sure to be had for them! A golden chance taken at just the right moment!"
 JAP_Teijin_Incident.1.A: "Tick, tick, tick, tick..."

 JAP_Teijin_Incident.2.t: "A Financial Conundrum"
 JAP_Teijin_Incident.2.d: "ROTTEN TO THE CORE: FINANCE MINISTRY BEHIND TEIJIN INSIDER TRADING? \n\nThat was the headline flashed across the Abatake editorial page, early this morning. Inside the article itself, an unknown writer laid out a ‘bribery’ scandal in detail, claiming that advisors inside the Ministry of Finance were behind a scheme to give the Banchokai investors an “insider trading tip”, before the stock of Teijin Corporation Ltd. rose dramatically over the previous 6 months. He then asserted the venture went all the way to the top leadership of the Bank of Taiwan, with Shigeru Shimada, President, directly involved. That wasn’t even the end of it. By the final sentence, ministers in the Finance, Commerce, Industry and even Railroad Ministries had all been named in the article, baselessly.\n\nOf course, the implications are totally ludicrous and unfounded. The Ministry of Finance had no idea that the Teijin stock purchase even took place! There is simply no way they can manage and maintain every single stock purchase and selling on a daily basis. Moreover, Shimada has a legitimate alibi, showing he was not aware of the ongoing selling of Teijin’s stocks. As usual in Japan, the press is used as a silly tool to try and derail any sense of good government with the NUC. \n\nHowever, all that said, everyone is reading it. All across Osaka, Tokyo and even Kyoto itself, the Abatake paper is seen everywhere. The politicians, the bankers, the shopkeepers and even the vagrants are all consuming the article as a state of fact! Within the government itself, there are rumblings of instability everywhere, with Ichiro Hatoyama, Minister of Education, outwardly saying he will resign shortly. \n\nWhoever it was that wrote this, they have created a scandal unlike any before it, almost totally out of thin air. And within the Empire, scandals almost always lead to disaster..."
 JAP_Teijin_Incident.2.A: "The horizon of the Rising Sun grows dark."

 JAP_Teijin_Incident.3.t: "A Disgraced Minister"
 JAP_Teijin_Incident.3.d: "Despite any major proof, despite any real subjective evidence, and despite the sworn statements from most members of cabinet, the political situation in Tokyo has descended into turmoil, all on the heels of the unknown editorial published six months ago. What was once thought to be a simple tabloid piece has now inflamed all of government, leaving many political observers stunned at the smoldering crisis.\n\nIt started with Ichiro Hatoyama, Minister of Education, resigning a mere two weeks after the editorial showed up. Then, more editorials began to appear in other papers. While they are mostly rehashes of the original content, like the first, people are clamoring to read them. From the proles to the proppers, the citizens of the nation are captivated by this total farce. A self-immolating flame, keeping the story alive. And as if the fire wasn’t strong enough, members of our own National Government have just poured kerosene on the embers.\n\nLate last night, the Ministry of Justice, led by the fervent ultra-nationalist Hiranuma Kiichiro, issued warrants of arrest for the Vice-Minister of Finance, director of the Bank of Taiwan and the President of the Teijin Cooperation himself. Kiichiro has appointed himself the chief prosecutor in the case, and while a trial could prove the Cabinet’s innocence, the proceedings could last for months and would cast a terrible light on the NUC. One that Saito is not willing to allow.\n\nWith the expectation of even more warrants for cabinet members to be issued shortly, the Prime Minister is asking all his advisors to resign, en masse."
 JAP_Teijin_Incident.3.A: "Democracy must be protected, at any cost."

 JAP_Teijin_Incident.4.t: "The Admiral In Charge"
 JAP_Teijin_Incident.4.d: "Nobody expected the dissolution of the government to result from a small group of young investors being accused of stock market manipulation. But that is exactly what occurred.\n\nIt all started when the Banchokai, a group of young investors, bought stock in Teijin, a leading rayon and textile company. By the end of the year, the stock had grown to 175% of its buying value. This fuelled speculation that the Banchokai was manipulating markets.\n\nThe rumour of the Banchokai manipulating markets reached ultra rightist officials in the Ministry of Justice, who began accusing officials in the Ministry of Finance and members of Prime Minister Sait Makoto's cabinet as well. Soon after, the Vice-Minister of Finance, the director of the Bank of Taiwan, and the President of Teijin were arrested. Prime Minister Makoto dissolved his government after learning that many of his cabinet members would be arrested as well.\n\nThe man to take over was none other than Admiral Keisuke Okada. Admiral Okada had a long and fruitful career in the Navy, retiring after nearly 49 years of service. He was one of the few supporters of the London Naval Treaty of 1930, which aimed to reduce naval arms. He also served as Navy Minister under Prime Minister Makoto.\n\nHe is one of the strongest democratic and moderate voices against the increasing strength of the militarists, and so it is assumed that he will be a major target for extremist forces. It is unclear, for now, how he will govern without the support of these factions."

 # Hirota Cabinet
 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.1.t: "2.26 Incident"
 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.1.d: "\"How could this be happening?\", asked Shirō Nonaka to no one in particular. It was a fair enough question. For someone who believed his group had the divine will of the Emperor behind them, victory should have been imminent. And yet, here he stood in the Tokyo Metropolitan Police headquarters, about to be stormed by the army. He glanced out the window to the army regiments outside, and then to the pistol on his side. He unholstered it and gazed at the inscriptions on its side.\n\nThe plan had started so well. He and a few other IJA officers had mobilized over a thousand other young army soldiers to storm several important administrative centers in Tokyo. They assassinated some of the most prominent enemies of the kokutai, then submitted their demands, the dismissal of several officers in opposition to their goals and the appointment of a new cabinet led by Mazaki. The rest would have been decided by the Emperor once he recognized the righteousness of our goals. They had failed, though.\n\nNonaka slammed his fists against the wall in anger. They never gained any support from the Emperor, nor did they gain any concessions. Three days had passed, and their positions had only weakened in that time. At that very moment, thousands upon thousands of soldiers stood at their doorsteps ready to attack their position. They would almost certainly be overrun, and he would likely be put before a firing squad. Unless...\n\nHe gave a final glance at his pistol before closing his eyes and putting the barrel to the side of his head."

 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.2.d: "Saionji Kinmochi sat back and watched from afar as men cleared out cabinets and desks all about the government building. It was a sobering moment as he watched those government men take away any trace of those who had come before. It was as if the Kodoha faction had been wiped from the face of the earth, its members either dead or in prison. Not that Sionji had ever supported the group, in fact he had spent a great deal of time opposing their aims. However, to imagine that all of this could have occurred could have been inconceivable to the man a few years ago. \n\nRegardless, he reflected, life moves on. Japan’s political scene was in total disarray, and he was in a position to take advantage of this chaos. While the Toseiha faction is now firmly in control of the government, individual factions within the Toseiha are all vying for power in this new political dynamic. This disorganized state of affairs was only compounded by the resignation of the Okada cabinet, leaving another big power vacuum open that could only wait for so long. \n\nThe elder statesman rose from his seat watching the building across the way and started on the road back down into Tokyo. The political landscape had indeed shifted, and he had every intention of taking advantage of it. The Toseiha faction would be brought into line, and with it Saionji would mold a new Japan."

 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.3.d: "Saionji Kinmochi could not believe what he was hearing from his former apprentice. He was giving Konoe the opportunity of a lifetime, ascension to the Prime Ministership of Japan. One of the most powerful positions in government, and yet he was refusing?\n\n“You understand what I am offering to you here”, asked the elder statesman, somewhat incredulously, “You would have near unlimited legislative control of the government.”\n\n“I’m sorry”, the younger man responded, taking care to look at his former master directly, “The political situation is too unstable right now. A failure at this juncture could kill my political career. As flattered as I am, I cannot accept this position.”\n\nThe two had been talking for well over two hours, and yet their conversation had gone nowhere. As the younger Konoe turned to leave, Saionji felt an incredible frustration well up inside him. He had hinged his plans on having Konoe in office. He had molded the boy, made him into a fine politician, and now he turns his back on the man who made him. Admittedly, the two had grown distant in the years since their time at the Kyoto Imperial University, but he still trusted him\n\nFine! If Konoe wouldn’t do it, he just had to substitute in someone else. Someone diplomatic and inoffensive. Someone to bridge the gap between Okada’s term and the future. However, with Japanese politics as volatile as it was right now, who could possibly keep the peace? It was then when the idea struck him. It wouldn’t be perfect, but it would just have to hold everyone over until someone better could be found for the prime ministership. He signalled to his attendant to bring him the phone."

 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.4.d: "As the speaker droned on with his speeches and formalities, Saionji couldn’t help but wonder if this was really his best option. Keeping this government together could prove difficult, even with a man as inoffensive as Kōki Hirota. In recent months he had increasingly seen the military as a threat to Japan’s continued stability. Rising aggression and demands on the part of the military was starting to erode civilian control over the government, and while Hirota had certainly displayed excellent compromise and negotiation skills in the past, negotiating with these kinds of people might prove impossible. \n\n“... hereby inaugurate Kōki Hirota as Prime Minister”\n\nSnapped out of his abstraction, Saionji began to clap with the rest of the crowd as Hirota approached the podium and began to speak. As Hirota progressed deeper into the speech, Saionji pondered on the councillors on either side of him. These spineless fools were who allowed the political situation to get as volatile as it has. If they don’t start harder stances against military incursion on civilian governmental powers, all could be lost.\n\nAs Hirota wrapped up his speech and the Diet began to clap in one last big applause, Saionji could only watch the man as he stepped down from the podium and began to shake hands and talk with the influential members around him."
 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.4.A: "Godspeed, Kōki Hirota."

 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.5.t: "The General Demands Arita"
 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.5.d: "“This is ridiculous! Outrageous! How could they possibly demand such a thing! Kōki Hirota had been fuming over the military's latest demand for hours now. The military had objected to the appointment of Shigeru Yoshida to Hirota's cabinet, and instead suggested one Hachirō Arita, a Diet member with ties to the military who had been pushing for Japan to go to war with the rest of Asia for years. Saionji had warned the man of what becoming Prime MInister would entail, but Hirota had never expected such bold disregard for government tradition.\n\nHirota glared angrily at the note on his desk that had requested this appointment on the military’s behalf. Those pigheaded military men seemed intent in challenging him at every juncture. They had voiced opposition to his appointment from the very beginning, and he knew demands like these were meant to further disorganize and derail his administration. And he also knew that he couldn’t yet afford to burn bridges with these people. \n\nHe forced himself to take a breath before picking up his pen and signing off on the appointment of Hachirō Arita to the cabinet. It was a bitter pill to swallow, but he did not need Yoshida in his cabinet to function. This new government administration would survive."

 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.6.t: "The Cabinet Research Bureau"
 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.6.d: "Bureaucracy is an important part of any functioning government, a fact that Mori knew well. If nothing else, his twenty-five years of service for the government of Japan had taught him that. It didn’t change the fact that Mori hated his job. Day in and day out, he came into the office a haggard facsimile of a man, grouchy and quick to anger. He loathed the seemingly eternal drudgery of writing report after report, answering calls, and reading telegrams all day.\n\nOne might wonder why a man would put himself through such torture at a job they hated so much. It was not as though he couldn’t find work elsewhere. He had years of experience. No, the truth is that Mori had a secret. He was one of the most powerful men in Japan. On his small worn desk in his tiny cramped office sat a small brass plaque that read: Head of the Cabinet Research Bureau. At first glance, it was just a small office,  with rarely enough space for mountains of paperwork that got shoveled through. Nevertheless, it was responsible for all bureaucratic coordination and policy implementation in the Japanese government.\n\nThe effect of this was that Mori had the power to sink entire administrations should he so choose. With the right ink on the right paper, Mori could ensure the failure of any government programs he wished. Or, if he so chooses, Mori could grind the government to a halt by destroying the bureaucracy’s top-down coordination. Mori could neutralize any movement or opposition to the government by suffocating any opposition in red tape.\n\nAnd though he had never felt the need to act on this power, the fact that he could keep him going. His office kept the government’s bureaucratic organs functioning well with one another and making sure policy rollouts succeeded. Despite his cramped office and creaky old desk, he nonetheless kept on, proud in the secret knowledge that he was the most powerful man in Japan."
 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.6.A: "One of the enduring truths of the nation’s capital is that bureaucrats survive."

 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.7.t: "The National Defense State?"
 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.7.d: "Baba Eiichi was a man with a simple understanding of the world. Though he was no communist, Mao likely summarized his views best when he said, \"Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun\". It was a quote that had been bounding about in his head recently, and for good reason. Some months ago he found himself appointed Home Minister of Japan, and since that fateful day he had been working diligently towards ensuring that if power came from the gun, Japan would have the biggest one.\n\nIt was for this reason he was chuckling to himself so profusely as he put the final stamp and seal on the new budget for the Japanese government in the year of 1937. A 40% increase in total expenditures over the previous year, this budget made extensive funds available for all sorts of military purposes including the building of new recruitment infrastructure, the purchase of new armaments and weapons, as well as substantive increase in pay and benefits for officers and generals within the army and navy.\n\nA worthy beginning, to be sure, but not certainly not enough for a man like Baba Eiichi. His, as well as those who had put him there, ultimate object was a state built around that eternal engine of human progress, war. Japan would be victorious in goal, destined to rule the eight corners of the world unchallenged, or it would perish trying."

 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.8.d: "\"How can you, and in truth most members of this diet, continue to bring such disloyalty and dishonor upon our distinguished military? How can you insult us so?\", asked General Hisaichi Terauchi. The general had been yelling at him for minutes on end now. As a member of the Rikken Seiyūkai and speaker of the house, Kunimatsu Hamada represented the military’s greatest obstacle to complete control of the government.\n\n \"Dishonor? Insult? I have done no such things, and I’ll commit harakiri if such accusations are proven otherwise. Perhaps you ought to do the same\", retorted the elder statesman. Instantaneously he realized what he had said.\n\nIt was a rare thing to get silence in the House of Representatives. While a certain measure of decorum was enforced in the chamber, there were always side conversations, people shuffling around, the crinkling of paper. Total silence was wildly uncommon. And yet, Kunimatsu Hamada had achieved just that.\n\nAnd yet, after a moment, one statesman stood up. He stood alone for a moment, before another representative beside rose up as well. Then another rose, and another, before the entire hall stood together in solidarity with the speaker of the house. The general angrily stared back at Kunimatsu before turning, and walking straight out of the House of Representatives building."

 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.9.t: "The Only Option"
 JAP_Hirota_Cabinet.9.d: "It was over. Kōki Hirota’s prime ministership had reached the end of the line. He looked mournfully around his office as he struggled with his resignation letter. He had tried, truly he had. He had mediated, compromised, gave concessions, everything. But one damned incident in the house of representatives, and all his previous military support, however minimal it may have been, completely disappeared.\n\nHe didn’t know truly whether they feared he was stoking some kind of anti-military sentiment, or just chose to boot him as a message to others that no government could operate without military support, but either way it no longer mattered to him. Continuing this government as its leader was simply no longer possible. Treading on the military’s tail was dangerous, and operating without their support, even a tacit amount of it, could bring about the end of civilian government as a whole. God knows what would happen if the military ever decided to take matters into their own hands\n\nHe sighed as he looked over the words of his resignation over and over again. Even in defeat he sought to ensure his loss was one of grace and humility. He wondered if anyone would even care to read the resignation."

 # Hayashi Cabinet
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.1.t: "Cleaning the Mess"
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.1.d: "\"What an impossible situation,\" reflected Saionji Kinmochi on the current state of Japanese politics. He had nominated ten Prime Ministers as the last surviving Genrō, all of whom were relatively simple choices. Simply elect the President of the majority party in the Diet and wait for reinforcements the army and navy to back it up.\n\nBut this time was different. Kinmochi knew he was at the mercy of the military this time, with the previous Prime Minister, Hirota, reinstating the military's vast control over the government.\n\nKazushige Ugaki appeared to be the clear winner. He could be the right person to solve Japan's current political problems, with a moderate foreign policy and opposition to the military's increasingly fascistic trends. But would the military back him up? After all, they were heavily influenced by fascistic ideals at this point. Perhaps they'll agree, or perhaps they'll flatly refuse? What would he d-\n\n\"Honourable Genrō, may I suggest a candidate?\" a voice interrupted Kinmochi's thoughts. Fumimaro Konoe was his protege.\n\"Speak up, my son.\" Kinmochi's voice did little to conceal his interest and curiosity. \"Senjr Hayashi.\" Had his protégé found a way out of a situation that he himself thought was impossible? As he handed over some prepared papers to his old mentor, Konoe said.\n\nAs he flipped through them, Kinmochi's face became concerned. Right-wing, expansionist, increased military power... this man seemed to embody everything he was against. Kinmochi suspected Konoe was drawn to fascism, but he had no idea how strong the attraction was. Putting forward a candidate for Prime Minister with whom he would never agree? What in the world was Konoe thinking?\n\nOn the other hand, Konoe could be correct. Putting Hayashi in charge may help to appease the military and bring them under control. Who knows, maybe the right-wing candidate will be the one to restore the status quo."
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.1.A: "Konoe's suggestion is worth considering."
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.1.B: "No, Ugaki is still our best choice."

 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.2.t: "Konoe's Gambit"
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.2.d: "Seeing Kinmochi contemplate on his suggestion, Konoe doubled down. \"Master, Kazushige Ugaki... he doesn't have the support of the military. In fact, the military likely hates him for everything that happened to them during his tenure as Army Minister.\"\n\n\"He is the most moderate minister we have, Konoe. He's the only one completely opposed to the rising fascism in the military too.\" Kinmochi responded.\n\n\"I mean no disrespect, honourable Genrō, but isn't that exactly what makes it likely that the army will kill his cabinet before it even gets started? Or have you forgotten that they now have the ability to destabilize civilian governments at their whim?\" Konoe argued back, his tone becoming more assertive and his demeanor more aggressive.\n\n\"My protégé, please be patient. Do not let fear of the military control your thinking.\" Kinmochi answered calmly.\n\nFor a brief moment, Konoe closed his eyes and collected himself. \"I'm sorry, my most revered Master, but in my opinion, Hayashi is a far more viable option than Ugaki. Hayashi may be right-wing, but he is not a fascist. And a right-wing but capable Prime Minister is preferable to none at all.\"\n\n\"You may be right, my child.\" Kinmochi sighed. Konoe certainly had a point.\n\nAfter all, Hayashi wasn't such a bad candidate. While Ugaki would have been a better choice, Kinmochi was well aware of the military's opposition to his appointment. While he despised having to choose a Prime Minister under military constraints, he recognized he had no choice. With a heavy sigh, he finally came to the conclusion that Hayashi was indeed the best choice in these circumstances."
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.2.A: "Let's see what Hayashi can do to improve the situation."

 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.3.t: "The Marshal of Korea"
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.3.d: "Kazushige Ugaki walked with his collar straightened. He was uneasy about having all eyes on him as he walked to his destination. Saionji Kinmochi had summoned him. Ugaki was well aware that Kinmochi was the last surviving Genrō, and that Kinmochi held high regard for him. As such, he knew, with some certainty, why he was called.\n\nBut he hoped that was not the case.\n\nAs he entered, Kinmochi greeted him graciously, "Ah, Kazushige Ugaki. The Marshal of Korea. Thank you for coming before me."\n"It is a great honour, respectable Genrō." Ugaki said, as he bowed his most respectful bow.\n"Ah, yes, Genrō. That I am." Kinmochi sighed. "You also know, of course, that it means I have the responsibility of nominating the next Prime Minister?"\n"Of course, sir."\n"I have chosen you, Kazushige."\n\nThe collar tightened around Ugaki's throat. The position's responsibilities made him feel suffocated. "Sir, your choice has humbled me greatly. I will accept this position fully intending to carry out my responsibilities and lead this country to the best of my ability."\n\nKinmochi sighed. "You have my blessings and my best wishes. This is not an easy job. But I know you will do excellently." He smiled.\nUgaki returned the smile, turned, and walked away without saying anything.\n\nBoth of their smiles vanished as soon as Ugaki left. They were both aware that this was far from over. They knew the battle had only just begun."
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.3.A: "Hopefully Ugaki was the right choice."

 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.4.t: "Army Threatens the Ugaki Cabinet"
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.4.d: "It took Ishiwara a few more minutes to join the men in his room. When he saw them, he sighed in annoyance. But he quickly brought upon a smile on his face, and greeted Kinmochi.\n\n\"Most respectable Genrō, it is an honour to meet you.\" He said, bowing respectfully.\nThen he turned to Ugaki. Ugaki smiled. \"General Ugaki.\" he said with a scowl on his face, bowing for but a second. Ugaki's feeble smile withered away.\n\nTrying his best to ignore Ishiwara's disrespect for him, Ugaki began as Ishiwara went ahead and sat down in his seat. \"General Ishiwara, as I'm sure you already know, the honourable Genrō here has nominated me as the next Prime Minister. As such, I am here to request that you nominate an Army Min-\"\n\"The military does not support your cabinet.\" Ishiwara said calmly.\n\nUgaki could feel his calm fading. \"But why?\" he nearly screamed.\n\"As Army Minister, you have significantly weakened the military. I'm sure you recall the March Incident. Your tenure as Marshal of Korea hasn't been kind to you either.\"\n\"What exactly do you mean?\"\n\"General Ugaki, your ties to the zaibatsu are no secret. We know you got to know them well during your time in Korea.\"\n\"But-\"\n\"General, the decision is final.\" Ishiwara instructed them to leave in the most polite manner possible.\n\nKinmochi said not one word. As he thought about it, Kinmochi realised there was another choice, one that his protégé had recommended: Senjūrō Hayashi."
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.4.A: "Ugaki's cabinet is clearly dead. Time to move on."

 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.5.t: "Public Outcry over the Ugaki Debacle"
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.5.d: ""Takahiro, have you read today's news? Ugaki's cabinet is no more." said Asahi, as he sipped on a cup of tea and pored over the Asahi Shimbun.\n"What did you expect, gentlemen? Ugaki destroyed the military when he was Army Minister, he definitely should not get to be Prime Minister then." said the shop owner as he brought a cup of tea over to Takahiro's table.\n"But what does Ugaki's tenure as Army Minister have to do with him being a civilian Prime Minister?" Asahi enquired. "And why do the military have so much power over who takes care of civilian business?"\n\nTakahiro quietly sipped his tea as he listened.\n"I think its because Minister Hirota had to calm the military down after that February 26 Incident."\n"Ah, yes, the military organizes a coup and after that, they get more power. Tell me, Hachiro, in what world does that make sense?" retorted Asahi, his voice getting more and more aggressive.\n\nThe shop owner said nothing as he quietly brewed tea.\n"The military shouldn't have this much power over civilian matters. The purpose of it is to protect the civilians, not to meddle in civilian affairs!" continued Asahi. Now that he knew he had no opposition, he could say anything he wanted. "Does the civilian government have any power in the military? No, of course not. But the military gets to topple our governments at will!"\n\nTakahiro sipped his tea quietly as Asahi launched into a full-fledged rant about the situation. He had a feeling it wasn't just Asahi. He was aware that others felt the same way. He knew deep down that people didn't just feel this way here. He was aware that people were ranting about it in tea stalls, shops, and homes across the country..."
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.5.A: "This will not sit well with the people."

 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.6.t: "The Devil's Patron"
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.6.d: "As he sipped his tea, Kinmochi could feel a light breeze on his face. Outside, he could hear birds chirping and the dull sound of people conversing somewhere far away. Unlike his own state of mind, it was quite peaceful outside.\n\nHe had made the decision to name Senjurō Hayashi as the next Prime Minister. Despite his initial reservations, he'd grown increasingly convinced that Hayashi was the right choice. Still, he was uneasy about handing power to a right-winger.\n\nA voice interrupted his train of thought, "Honourable Genrō." Hayashi had arrived and was now respectfully bowing before him.\n"General Hayashi." Kinmochi returned a small bow with a smile. "I assume you already know why I called you here?"\n"Certainly, sir. I gratefully accept your nomination and pledge to perform my duties to the best of my ability."\n"Well, then, good luck." Kinmochi closed his eyes and returned to his tea.\n\nKinmochi's abrupt resolution of the conversation did not go unnoticed by Hayashi. But he didn't care. In any case, the whole thing was a formality. As Hayashi walked away, the gravity of the situation became clear to him. He could feel the power of the position in his hands, as well as the weight of the position's responsibility on his shoulders.\n\nHe had ambitious plans for Japan. He could now work on making them a reality."
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.6.A: "We shall see how it goes."

 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.7.t: "Tie-up Finance"
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.7.d: "The Hayashi administration has finally announced the approval of a new budget after days of negotiations.\n\nThis new budget prioritizes the nation's armed forces and military production capabilities. It is a weaker but more effective substitute for the budget proposed by former Finance Minister Eiichi Baba. The budget also collaborates with local businesses and influential corporate organizations to improve the nation's military standing.\n\nPolitical observers have hailed this as the start of a "new era of military-business cooperation." With increased monetary flow into the military, Japan's armed forces are expected to soon be on par, if not outrank, those of the Western Powers. Some experts have also stated that this is a "warning to those seeking to exploit Japan," stating that "Japan is on the rise, and our destiny will be realised soon."\n\nHowever, some experts have taken a different stance on the issue. They see increased military revenue as evidence that Japan is drifting further away from democracy. They warn of an impending military takeover, either peacefully or violently. They argue that military investments should instead be directed toward the civilian sector in order to strengthen the economy and raise people's living standards.\n\nDespite the fact that opposing viewpoints have emerged, it appears that this budget will be regarded as one of the Hayashi administration's greatest achievements. As one of our government sources pointed out, "Only the voices of the military and businesses are important. They support it, so we have unanimous support.""
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.7.A: "Let's hope this doesn't backfire."

 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.8.t: "Businesses React Positively"
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.8.d: "The Hayashi Cabinet has gained popularity as businesses have declared their support for and approval of the new budget's implementation.\n\nWhile it was fully expected that businessmen with close ties to the government would support this budget, given their role in its creation, the reactions of more neutral and isolated corporations remained uncertain. The Hayashi Government was concerned about the lack of clarity in this matter because they couldn't move forward with their plans until they received and evaluated the reactions of the businessmen. However, it appears that the cloud of uncertainty surrounding this matter has lifted.\n\nAnonymous corporate sources have stated that, while they continue to oppose the increased emphasis on the military, they are unable to argue with the results. "If cooperation with the military is what it takes to bring prosperity and wealth to Japan, then we are absolutely willing to do so," one commentator said.\n\nNow that the business community has backed their plans, the Hayashi Cabinet can move forward with their reforms. While there is no doubt that their intentions are to strengthen Japan, the outcomes of their actions remain uncertain."

 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.9.d: ""Well, what about our economic plans?" Hayashi questioned the man who claimed to be a "conservative representative."\n"We will also not support that. I'm afraid you will not have us with you in your infrastructure plans as well," the man sneered.\n\nThe cabinet members murmured to one another. Hayashi clenched his fist. "I see you're not going to back any of my cabinet's initiatives. Why not?"\n"Officially because we believe these will cause an economic downturn. But privately..." the man explained as he approached Hayashi, "it's because you've taken away our corporate supporters."\n"But-"\n"There is nothing more to say, Prime Minister. I shall take my leave now."\n\nAs the man left the room, the cabinet members' chatter became more audible.\n"It's fine," Hayashi said, trying to persuade himself more than the cabinet members. "I am confident that the conservatives' obstinacy will be irrelevant as long as we have the support of the Diet."\n\n"Prime Minister, we do not believe the Diet will back us up."\nHayashi could feel his blood beginning to boil. "Why the hell not?" he exclaimed, taking a deep breath.\n"Perhaps we should ask the Diet members here," said another cabinet member in response to the question. He took a look around sarcastically. "Oh, no, they don't exist. How do you expect the Diet to support you when you won't even tell them what our reasoning and plans are?"\nMany of them agreed with a slight nod.\n"In that case, gentlemen, please allow me some time to think," he said, politely asking them to leave.\n\nHayashi assessed his situation. With both the conservatives and the Diet opposed to him, something needed to be done about them...."
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.9.A: "We will have to deal with them immediately."

 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.10.t: "Hayashi Calls Elections!"
 JAP_Hayashi_Cabinet.10.d: "As he read the reports, Hayashi's fingers tightened and his lips trembled. Infrastructure projects were abandoned. Economic plans were in disarray. Industrial projects had not even begun. Hayashi turned red as he read through paper after paper detailing his cabinet's failures. In a rage, he screamed and threw away the papers.\n\n\"The damn conservatives and imbeciles in the Diet are proving to be a huge impediment,\" he grumbled to himself. \"I have to do something about them.\"\n\nBut what could he do? Persuade them? It was too late for that. Bribe the members? He couldn't afford it. Propose other reforms? No other reforms were as effective as these.\n\nHe was irritated by his situation. He was the Prime Minister, and the Diet had brought him to heel. He, who had been appointed by the Emperor to lead Japan, was being thwarted by petty politics and self-serving politicians. The entire Diet was completely corrupt. None of its members could see beyond their respective political parties. Political parties had divided everyone and prevented any progress from being made. The problem was the Diet, not its members.\n\nAn idea came rushing to him, as if an angel from above whispered it into his ears: Dissolve the Diet.\n\nHe was well aware that he was taking a risk. Some would call it reckless. However, dissolving the diet would give him the time he needed to plan his reforms. The conservatives would be avoided. Most importantly, it would result in the formation of a one-party state. A state free of petty politics.\n\nHe knew exactly what he had to do."

For the past fifteen minutes, he had been trying to meditate with little success.\n\nAs he took a deep breath, he said, "Inner peace." But he knew his thoughts begged to differ. How could he focus on his breathing when there was an election choking him by the throat? How could he try to stay calm when the results of this election would change the destiny of Japan? How could he try to meditate when he and the nation were in a period of immense turmoil?\n\n'Maybe some water will calm me down', he thought as he grabbed a nearby cup of water and took a sip. The cold water seemed to alleviate some of the discomfort.\n\nOne of Hayashi's aides came running into the room. Out of breath, he said, "Sir, the election has been concluded."\nHayashi's grip on the cup tightened. "And?" he nearly screamed.\n"Sir, it appears...." the aide hesitated, partly to catch his breath and partly because the news he bore was not exactly positive. "It appears we have lost."\n\nHayashi could feel the pressure on his throat transform into a sinking feeling in his stomach. He could feel the cup slipping from his hands and falling to the ground, shattering into a thousand pieces, much like his dreams for a strong Japan.\n\nHis gamble had failed. His plans were destroyed. His position was lost. Now, all he could do was to submit his resignation and leave with honour."

I humbly accept your appointment, and promise to carry out my responsibilities to the best of my ability."\n\nKinmochi replied, "You will always have my blessings, my child. All that is left for me to do is to wish you luck and send you on your way."\nKonoe bowed. "Yes, sir. I will take my leave now."\n\nKinmochi calmly observed Konoe leave the room. After several weeks of political unrest, his protégé now held the highest government position. Kinmochi was confident in his selection this time after the failures of his prior nominees. He found solace in the knowledge that he could be certain Konoe acted according to his principles and would do so even in his capacity as prime minister.\n\nOne idea steadily emerged in Kinmochi's head, however, as he thought back on the other occasions. It gradually took over all of his thoughts, like a weed he couldn't get rid of. He pondered, "What if Konoe had planned this from the start? What if Hayashi was only for him a means to an end? What if he elects to serve as Prime Minister and adopts his right wing beliefs?"\n\nKinmochi no longer felt at ease."

The letter he received talks about a problem on the Chinese border, more precisely near the city of Wanping. As our troops were training for military exercises, one of our soldiers was absent during the review of the troops.\n\nImmediately, our officers on the spot asked the Chinese for permission to frisk the region, in order to find the lost soldier. They answered with a polite “No”, and the officers started to accuse the Chinese government of having kidnapped him. Quickly, the situation started to degenerate, and on both sides of the border, shots were exchanged.\n\nWith a touch of dramatic irony, the lost soldier has returned to the military base a few hours later, coming back from a brothel. But with the situation already in full swing, his return has not calmed anyone on the front.\n\nNow, Konoe has to face two harsh choices: he could call for a cessation of all hostilities in the region, including troops on their side of the border; or he can seize the opportunity, and send even more troops to China."

The list of the domains concerned by the law continue to expand, as trade unions, strategic industries, corporates and prices, and even rationing are all under the control of the political sphere.\n\nAfter the passing of the law, many workers were reassigned from some jobs, so as ensure they are where the government needs them to be. Another consequence is the augmentation of the budgets of subsidies in enterprises, given by the government to compensate the manufacturers for their losses.\n\nIf some qualify this law as “unconstitutional”, some others argue that the times of war allow the country to sacrifice some liberties to be sure the country can survive long enough to recover them."

 JAP_First_Konoe_Cabinet.4.t: "The Cabinet Reshuffle"
 JAP_First_Konoe_Cabinet.4.d: "After a few changes in the cabinet, Prime Minister Konoe has decided to oust Hajime Sugiyama, the marshal who has occupied the post of War Minister for a while.\n\nHe has notably decided to remove him because of his pro-war opinions, and, after a few deliberations, Konoe has appointed Seishiro Itagaki as his successor, mostly because of his adhesion to his allegiance to the non aggression faction of the cabinet.\n\nAfter a few other changes, it seems that most of the cabinet members are now from this non aggression faction, and some even think that Konoe wants to remove the militarists from the political equation.\n\nUnfortunately for him, the situation is not that glorious. Some discredited the choice of Itagaki because of his lack of initiative. On the other hand, some criticise his intentions to appoint Kazushige Ugaki to the post of Foreign Minister, because of his excessive desire to make peace.\n\nIf nobody knows where the new cabinet will lead, the opposition to Konoe are as many as his supporters in the cabinet, and the situation will have to evolve if he wants to see something emerge from the government."

 # Hiranuma Cabinet
 JAP_Hiranuma_Cabinet.1.t: "The Prince's Departure"
 JAP_Hiranuma_Cabinet.1.d: "Saionji couldn't decide whether he should be happy or sad. After learning of Konoe's resignation due to peace negotiations failing and the war dragging on longer than expected, he could not help but feel a mix of both. When they discussed foreign affairs and politics, Saionji's liberalism and Konoe's contradictory attraction to fascism frequently clashed. Still, even if they disagreed on a lot of things, Konoe was still his pupil and he was his mentor. After all, he was the one who nominated Konoe to be the Emperor's Prime Minister, so he couldn't help but feel pride when he accepted the position and now disappointment as he resigned.\n\nHowever, he could not be happier about Konoe's replacement, Hiranuma Kiichirō. Having established a reputation during his time at the Ministry of Justice as a strong opponent of government corruption and serving as the director of the Tokyo High Court, public prosecutor of the Supreme Court, Director of the Civil and Criminal Affairs Bureau, former Minister of Justice and now President of the Privy Council, he is an honourable and well-respected man and Saionji could not think of a better man for the job."

 JAP_Hiranuma_Cabinet.2.t: "A Shift in Europe"
 JAP_Hiranuma_Cabinet.2.d: "Different meeting, same topic. Hiranuma was getting tired of it all. From the moment he became Prime Minister, his administration was dominated by the same debate over and over about whether Japan should form an alliance with Germany to counter the Soviet Union's threat to Japan. He knows an anti-communist pact against the Soviet Union is a necessary precaution, but they can't afford to let this military alliance drag Japan into a war against the United States and the United Kingdom. As most of the Japanese armed forces are still committed to the war against China, it would ensure Japan's annihilation.\n\nThis conundrum, with no apparent solution, has occupied his entire administration, preventing him from addressing many other critical issues. As he was about to prepare himself to have the same debate and give the same speech for the 50th time, the door to the conference room swung open. Someone brought word from the ambassadors in Germany:\n\nA German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact."

In his final speech, he explained his reasons for resigning, the most important of which was his inability to deal successfully with current foreign policy issues.\n\nThe Japanese people are both optimistic and concerned. Hiranuma was known to be a man of honour, respect, and most importantly, competence. If even he is incapable of dealing with Japan's current crisis, who can?"

What happened to Hiranuma Kiichirō?”\n“He has resigned.”\n“And I was suggested to succeed him? But why?”\n“The Army probably thought you were a good choice, sir.”\n\nAfter a few minutes to prepare himself, Abe finally went with the soldier to the government building. Sadly, he will probably not be able to rest tonight.\n\nAfter a few conversations with those he knew there, he learns that he has been appointed for a few reasons: another candidate for the ministry, Ugaki Kazushige, was hospitalised, and, after a few debates, it was agreed that Abe was a good compromise candidate: he is neutral towards army factions, he has good experiences from his post in foreign affairs, and, finally, he is relatively moderate.\n\nAbe sighed as he settled into his new office."
 JAP_Abe_Cabinet.1.A: "Let’s get to work"

 JAP_Abe_Cabinet.2.t: "A Fresh Face"
 JAP_Abe_Cabinet.2.d: "General Nibuyuki Abe has been appointed the 37th Prime Minister of the Japanese Empire following his nomination. The man was chosen for this position because of his known neutrality between the army's factions, the Tōseiha and the Kōdōha, or the Militarist and Imperial factions. The fact that he has never belonged to either of those two factions is good news because he can communicate with both without offending either, and he cannot be accused of favouritism when dealing with them.\n\nAbe is also unique in that the Navy supports him because of his political moderation: he has no great ambitions for power and will most likely not be a threat to the militarists. Finally, his experience as a Foreign Minister will benefit him because he understands the global political situation, and he will most likely try to form new alliances with Japan's ideological allies, possibly even ending the war in China.\n\nDespite these positives, a number of Army senior officers do not respect him because of his lack of combat experience, and we are concerned that they will not be of much assistance to him when he needs it."

 JAP_Abe_Cabinet.3.t: "Facing the War's Expenses"
 JAP_Abe_Cabinet.3.d: "Japan has been at war with Asia for many years. Japanese enemies are hidden and ready to attack everywhere, including Russia and China. However, in order to fight the war, the country requires armament, oil, ships, and aviation, all of which come at a high cost to our economy.\n\nPrime Minister Nobuyuki Abe proposed a solution to this complicated situation a few days ago. He specifically requested that we experiment with integrated trade practises, claiming that their use will greatly benefit us if we want to buy material from foreign powers. In fact, aligning our prices with theirs could be a great idea, combining both an improvement in relations with potential trade partners and fewer difficulties in finding appropriate equipment. It could also prevent price escalation in the event of a war stalemate, and price stability is the bare minimum we need to win in the end.\n\nAbe is waiting for his collaborators' responses after presenting his idea to the assembly for thirty minutes. Will he be defeated, or will they accept his offer?"
 JAP_Abe_Cabinet.3.A: "The assembly will think about the proposal."

 JAP_Abe_Cabinet.4.t: "The Foreign Ministry Opposes Us"
 JAP_Abe_Cabinet.4.d: "Admiral Kichisaburō Nomura, Japan's new Foreign Minister, had strongly rejected Abe's proposal after some deliberation. He claimed that victory in the war with China is the main goal for the Shōwa Tennō and Japan, and that the conflict should end only when "all those damned Chinese have surrendered to the Imperial forces."\n\nAfter this first sentence, most current ministers begin to argue that, even if the cost of war is high, Abe's proposal, with his intention to cut funds, can hardly be called anything other than treason, because cutting the budget will only lead to poor equipment, a more difficult supply, and, in the end, defeat in battles, which will undermine troop morale.\n\nAbe finally left the government office a few hours later, seeing his total lack of support on this issue. He hopes to change the situation the next day by presenting another proposal for a strengthened alliance with Italy and Germany, both ideologically close to Japan.\n\nUnfortunately for him, his failure with his previous proposal has already undermined his authority, and the military is likely to remove him the moment he makes another mistake."
 JAP_Abe_Cabinet.4.A: "This didn’t go to plan..."

 JAP_Abe_Cabinet.5.t: "The Business World Abandons Us"
 JAP_Abe_Cabinet.5.d: "Another disaster for Nobuyuki Abe's project! Hearing about the Foreign Ministry's opposition and concerned about the impact on their profits, a few companies withdrew their support for the Prime Minister.\n\nInitially, all of their support was directed toward Abe's diplomatic project with the Axis or other powers. However, when he abruptly attempted to control prices and then the economy, the industrial world abruptly stopped following him.\n\nMost Zaibatsu complexes have rejected him, including Mitsubishi, a major manufacturer of ships, aircraft, and military equipment of all kinds, and Nissan, a major car and vehicle manufacturer. With the two major players abandoning him, most smaller businesses have given up, and Abe's support and influence, if not completely dead, are on the verge of dying.\n\nWhat will happen to him now is the question. Can he still hold power, or will he be deposed in the near future? Nobody knows... for the time being."

He was slightly depressed: for months, he had done his best to lead Japan in the right direction, approaching the country with the Fuhrer's and Duce's governments, and he even tried to extend diplomacy in Asia, to reinforce the Dai Tōa Kyōeiken, or Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, in the hope of securing Japan's position in Asia.\n\nUnfortunately, his lack of experience in both politics and the military has dogged his administration. He is aware that his career will be cut short. Inhaling sadly, he grabbed a blank sheet of paper and a pen and wrote: "Seeing my current situation, with the loss of much support, I today have made a sad decision...""

 # Yonai Cabinet
 JAP_Yonai_Cabinet.1.t: "Yet Another Conundrum"
 JAP_Yonai_Cabinet.1.d: "After the collapse of Abe's cabinet after just a few months due to increasingly lacking support from either the military or the political parties, the Japanese people are desperate for a stable government. Seeing how each of the last few cabinets collapsed after just a very short time, people are starting to lose hope.\n\nMitsumasa Yonai will become the new Prime Minister after some desperate scrambling and discussion to find a suitable replacement who will hopefully last more than a few months.\n\nServing in the Navy for many years, and most recently serving as Navy Minister and member of the Supreme War council, Admiral Yonai has shown strong leadership before, particularly in crisis. One of these times was his critical contribution to putting down an attempted coup d'état led by young officers of the Imperial Japanese Army. Furthermore, he has the Emperor's full support, making him an ideal replacement."
 JAP_Yonai_Cabinet.1.A: "Surely he will do better than his predecessors."

 JAP_Yonai_Cabinet.2.t: "Illusion of a New Structure"
 JAP_Yonai_Cabinet.2.d: "Any hope the Japanese people might have had at change or reform were quickly shattered. Yonai's cabinet has proven to be the exact same as the last few cabinets that all collapsed after a short while. Even though he continues his strong pro-British, pro-American stance he held as Navy Minister and his strong opposition to the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy, being overwhelmed by crisis and problems, the government is once again unable to resolve any of the pressing issues that plague the Japanese people and the country at large.\n\nFew people still have hope in this cabinet, with the majority having their faith and beliefs in this cabinet shattered. While the majority are apathetic to the new government, some are already calling for Yonai's resignation, especially from the side of the army."
 JAP_Yonai_Cabinet.2.A: "New face, same story."

 JAP_Yonai_Cabinet.3.t: "Hata Denounces Yonai"
 JAP_Yonai_Cabinet.3.d: "And just like that we have another crisis, and more importantly, another resignation on our hands. Yonai had been repeatedly criticised for his strong pro-British and pro-American stance, especially from the Army. With Germany's success in Europe, the Army's dissatisfaction with Yonai's anti-German and anti-Italian policy grew. The disagreement reached a boiling point when Army Minister Shunroku Hata openly criticised the Prime Minister and eventually resigned.\n\nThe Japanese Constitution requires the Army Minister to be an active-duty general and seeing how no other general will accept the position, due to the pro-Axis stance of the Imperial Japanese Army, Yonai is now forced to resign. It's time to start looking for another replacement."

Something more powerful, something capable of bringing the New World Order to light, with the Empire on top. If we truly share the same goals, why do we divide ourselves into factions in the first place? It's time for a new, unifying political party to unite all men and women under one banner. We already have nationalized many of our industries and war machines, isn't it time for us to do the same for our government?\n\nAfter staring out the window for so long, Konoe finally sat down at his desk.

The conflict in China needs to be resolved, whether it be peace or a continued effort for total victory.

Tojo has realised that the navy is unwilling to admit that it could not fight the United States, and he believes that you and your entire cabinet should resign and bear the responsibility for wrongfully calling for the imperial edict, which only Prince Higashikuni can reverse."\n\nKonoe's blood chilled; no matter how hard he tried to convince Tojo and his militarists that war with the United States would destroy the country, he had been ignored. He had failed, and all of his effort had resulted in this.\n\n"...You're dismissed, Suzuki..."\n\nSuzuki walks out of the office, and Konoe places his hands on his head."

 # Tojo Cabinet
 JAP_Tojo_Cabinet.1.t: "The Emperor's Will"
 JAP_Tojo_Cabinet.1.d: "The Emperor must appoint a successor following the resignation of former Prime Minister Fimumaro Konoe. Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni is said to be the only person who can command both the Army and the Navy, and he was recommended as Konoe's replacement by both Konoe and Hideki Tojo. The Emperor rejected this option, arguing that a member of the imperial family should not be held responsible for a war against the West because defeat would damage the House of Yamato's reputation. Hideki Tojo, known for his devotion to the imperial institution, is instead chosen.\n\nHe joined the Army in 1902 and quickly rose through the ranks to become a general by 1934. He was promoted to chief of staff of the Kwantung Army in March 1937, where he oversaw military operations against the Chinese in Inner Mongolia and the Chahar-Suiyan provinces. By July 1940, he had been appointed as Minister of War to the Japanese government, which was led by Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe. Tojo is an outspoken supporter of a pre-emptive attack on the United States and its European allies.\n\nBy tradition, the Emperor must obtain the approval of the elder statesmen before appointing a prime minister, and as long as former Prime Minister Admiral Keisuke Okada is opposed to Tojo, the Emperor should not appoint him. The Emperor is now proposing a compromise in which Tojo would become Prime Minister while "re-examining" the options for dealing with the crisis with the US, though no promise was made that Tojo would try to avoid war."
 JAP_Tojo_Cabinet.1.A: "Konoe does not understand military matters. I know much more."

 JAP_Tojo_Cabinet.2.t: "Striking the Giant"
 JAP_Tojo_Cabinet.2.d: "\"...which is why we must strike first.\" said Admiral Osami Nagano, sitting across from the Emperor. He'd been talking to the Emperor for what felt like hours, trying to persuade him to authorise a preemptive strike against the United States. One would think that as Chief of the Imperial Japanese Naval General Staff, he wouldn't have to practically beg the Emperor to follow his advice.\n\n"The target will be the United States naval base Pearl Harbor on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. The goal is to keep the United States Pacific Fleet from interfering with our planned military operations in Southeast Asia against the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and United States overseas territories. Over the course of several hours, coordinated attacks will be launched on the US-held Philippines, Guam, and Wake Island, as well as the British Empire in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong..."\n\nHe was thanked and told to leave as soon as he finished explaining the plan to the Emperor. It was unclear whether his words had persuaded the Emperor, but as the Admiral left the room, he was certain of one thing:"
 JAP_Tojo_Cabinet.2.A: "Time is running out."

 JAP_Tojo_Cabinet.3.t: "The Hull Note"
 JAP_Tojo_Cabinet.3.d: "Tojo received an unusual document today. American Secretary of State Cordell Hull presented a "draught mutual declaration of policy" and a "Outline of Proposed Basis for Agreement between the United States and Japan" to Ambassador Nomura and Kurusu Saburo in Washington. In exchange for the lifting of the oil embargo, Hull proposes that Japan "withdraw all military, naval, air, and police forces" from China and French Indochina. The "Hull note" makes it clear that the United States would not recognise Wang Jingwei's puppet government as the government of China, but it strongly implies that the United States might recognise the "Empire of Manchukuo" and does not impose a deadline for Japanese withdrawal from China.\n\nTojo, on the other hand, was outraged as soon as he read the note. In his mind, this was an ultimatum from the United States that could only be met in one way. Japan must choose between complying with US and UK demands, which would mean abandoning our success in China and the surrounding areas, or continuing with our expansionism. Concerned about losing hard-earned international status and prestige if Japan backs down, as well as the perceived threat to our national security posed by Western Powers controlling territory in the Pacific and East Asia, Tojo's choice is clear."
 JAP_Tojo_Cabinet.3.A: "We have already prepared military options, now we just have to carry them out."

 JAP_Tojo_Cabinet.4.t: "Tojo's Fall"
 JAP_Tojo_Cabinet.4.d: "Tojo is pondering in his dimly lit office. The war had begun fairly successfully, but the longer it goes on, the more battles we lose. He knows that at this point, at least some of the Japanese elite recognise that the war is lost and that Japan must make peace before it is destroyed. Worse, he had been so demonised in the United States during the war that he represented Japanese militarism to the American people, and it was unthinkable that the United States would make peace with a government led by him.\n\nHow did he end up in this position if he was always more of a follower than a leader? He's an army man at heart, and he should have left politics to the politicians. And now, behind his back, the elder statesmen are plotting, whining to the Emperor, demanding that his entire government resign. Of course, no one would say this to his face, but he was well aware of the plots to bring him down.\n\nThat is why he sought the Emperor's support once more, but all the Emperor had to say to him was something along the lines of: The man responsible for the war's failure is unworthy of his approval. He also proposed reorganising his cabinet in order to regain Imperial approval, but was turned down once more; the Emperor said the entire cabinet had to go. Already, word has spread that he no longer has the Emperor's support. With no allies left and no support from the Chrysanthemum Throne, there is only one option."
 JAP_Tojo_Cabinet.4.A: "I hereby declare my resignation."

 JAP_Tojo_Cabinet.5.t: "Convention of the Jushin"
 JAP_Tojo_Cabinet.5.d: "The Jushin advised the Emperor to appoint a former Prime Minister, Admiral Mitsumasa Yonai, as Tojo's replacement because he is well-liked by the Navy, diplomatic corps, bureaucracy, and the "peace faction." He is well-known for being pro-British and pro-American, and he remains staunchly opposed to the Tripartite Pact with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy.\n\nYonai, on the other hand, refused to serve, knowing full well that any Prime Minister who attempted to make peace with the Americans would be assassinated, as many Army officers were still committed to victory or death and saw any talk of peace as treason. He claims that only another general can be Prime Minister and recommends General Kuniaki Koiso in his place. However, the Emperor and the Jushin are wary of Koiso because of his previous involvement with the ultranationalist Sakura Kai and its attempted coup against the government in 1931. However, because no one could agree on a better alternative, Yonai's arguments won out.\n\nAt a meeting with the Emperor, Koiso and Yonai are told to work together to form a new government, but they are not told who will be Prime Minister. Because the Emperor is a living god, neither Yonai nor Koiso were able to ask him who would be Prime Minister, as one does not ask questions of a god, and as a result, both men are perplexed as to which of the two is now Prime Minister. Finally, Lord Privy Seal Kido clears the air by announcing that Koiso is the Prime Minister, with Yonai appointed Vice-Prime Minister to deal with strong opposition to Koiso."
 JAP_Tojo_Cabinet.5.A: "Will Koiso be able to turn the War around?"

 # Koiso Cabinet
 JAP_Koiso_Cabinet.1.t: "The Unlikely General"
 JAP_Koiso_Cabinet.1.d: "And with that, it's begun. Kuniaki Koiso has risen to the position of Prime Minister of Japan. He wondered what his old Korean friends would think of the "Tiger of Korea" now. He has a wealth of administrative experience, having served as Minister of Colonial Affairs in both Hiranuma Kiichiro's cabinet and the Yonai administration, as well as as Governor-General of Korea. He had been a soldier his entire life and would now be able to demonstrate to the Japanese people that military men are just as capable of leading the country as those sleazy politicians. Perhaps even better. This is something his predecessor, Tojo, failed miserably at. He would not make the same mistakes as that idiot.\n\nIdeas for changes and ways to strengthen the army rushed through his mind. He had the ability to do so now, so he should make the most of it. He would ensure that the army is as strong as it should be. The army-navy rivalry would be one of the first issues he would have to address. A compromise, obviously in favour of the army, will have to be reached. The army is full of honourable men. It's past time for them to be recognised and given the power they deserve. Those who refer to him as a strawman or an army puppet have no idea what they are talking about."
 JAP_Koiso_Cabinet.1.A: "I AM the army."

 JAP_Koiso_Cabinet.2.t: "The Fallen General"
 JAP_Koiso_Cabinet.2.d: "And that's the end of it. Everything Koiso had worked so hard for was lost. What could have caused this? Poeple threw roadblocks in his path at every turn. No one took him seriously, and everyone questioned him. The army and navy quarrelled endlessly, generals openly disagreed with and even disobeyed his orders, and strategy after strategy failed. Japanese forces continue to suffer a string of defeats at the hands of the Allies on all fronts.\n\nHe considered making peace for a time, but he couldn't come up with a solution that would satisfy both the Japanese military and the Allies. He had no choice but to continue fighting. Finally, the legal system turned against him. Even his attempt to broaden his control over the army by simultaneously serving as War Minister and Prime Minister failed miserably.\n\nThe American forces are on our doorstep. A few hours ago, an American aircraft sank the Imperial Japanese Navy flagship Yamato. His demands for inclusion in military decisions were denied. He believed he could outperform his predecessor. He never imagined himself doing worse. It appears that all hope is now lost."

Additionally, the enormous amount of mineral resources scattered throughout the island, such as iron, lead, copper, aluminium, gold and nickel, are now under the direct supervision of the Australian Government-General, with local mining companies now required to employ our people, and trade exclusively with the member countries of the Co-Prosperity Sphere at advantageous prices.\n\nOur ultimate goal is to achieve minzoku kyōwa - racial harmony, with all people, regardless of their nationality, ethnicity or race, cooperating as equal citizens in a single society, but for the time being, His Majesty’s former subjects will receive certain benefits and privileges in order to further incentivise settlement and immigration.

 JAP_226_Events.5.d: "An ideological offspring of the GEACPS, the Greater East Asian Film Sphere is difficult to define. Essentially, its purpose is to completely remove the corrosive Western influences found in our society and eventually produce films that would represent a pure, “Oriental” spirit. Contrary to what the name might suggest however, only Japanese films are to be used, for practical reasons, as it is no surprise that the motion picture industry is severely lacking in our fellow East Asian neighbours, and it would take significant time and effort to foster. Using what already exists is far easier than creating something from scratch.\n\nHowever, the most important reason for using only Japanese films is best explained by our leading film critic, the venerable Iijima Tadashi, who states that the cinematic output present in other regions of East Asia "consists of elements that are at once foreign and domestic", and in conclusion damaging to the Sphere’s goal of eradicating Western imperialism in the region.\n\nMany of the potential films proposed by our filmmakers have China as the subject, a prime example of the sickening effects corruption, stagnation and Western influence can have on a nation. Contrasting with China's continued traditionalism are “Vow in the Desert” and “Green Earth”, two films produced by the Film Sphere that will be put on the big screen. These movies epitomise our ideals, with themes such as modernisation, progress and patriotism prevalent throughout. A keen audience might even notice that the solution to the conflict between traditionalism and modernisation is in plain sight: the Empire of Japan, now the technological leader of Asia and the rightful successor to the historical glory of China, capable of bringing them a new age, one of prosperity and happiness."

A conference of the member states in the Co-Prosperity Sphere will be held by us over a two day time span. What remains to be decided is what the conference itself will be about.\n\nThe obvious option would be to dedicate the conference to the ideal that we have espoused for the past decade, that of Pan-Asianism. Ever since its inception, the idea of a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, where all the Asian peoples would live together as brothers and sisters, was the main driving factor behind our ability to rally the various peoples of the region under our leadership. Continuing to use this recipe for success is only rational. Speeches by representatives from our neighbours, encouraging the Asian people to rally behind us against the European devils will be a sure success.\n\nHeartfelt speeches are indeed pivotal for the morale and unity of our Sphere, but what good are these when we lack the resources to back them up? Will the Pan-Asian ideal matter when soldiers of the West march upon the streets of Asia’s great cities, our warriors unable to stop their advance, our planes and ships too few to secure the air and sea around them? We have been unable to develop our forces to their full potential due to a chronic lack of resources, and as such, appealing to our “friends” for material assistance is another choice we could make. They will indubitably, even if begrudgingly, bow to our wishes.\n\nAnd, of course, there is always the option of this gathering being simply a way for us to reinforce the “commitment” of our fellow members to their leader, the Empire of Japan. You can never go wrong when you make sure the cogs of a machine are working as intended."

The IJN's 2nd Fleet bombarded strategic positions along the immediate coastline, to great effect. \n\nThis combined arms approached created an extremely chaotic situation for the garrison of Shanhaiguan, where the Great Wall of China meets the sea. Combined with inferior technological capability and better training in the Kanto-Gun, the battle became a bloodbath.

Sure, we could say that its one less territory off the Chinese vermin, and another victory for the Toku Heidan. No no, to fully understand it's value, we mustn't look at the pragmatism but on the symbolisms.\n\nRehe has context, a Manchurian context. It was a haven for the gentry and noble, most especially the Manchu Emperors, who stayed every summer in the Mountain Resort palace, a place where the Emperors could escape the political theatre of the Middle Kingdom. Of course, this was during the time when Emperors were revered in China, and not the tainted and misguided ideology of Republicanism that exists today.\n\nRehe now is just one of many territories the Nanking government \"controls,\" a land of banditry and anarchy with puny governors who are merely just warlords in disguise. As such, it is morally and symbolically right to retake Rehe for the Manchu people. \n\nThere are many ways to approach this.

Once Chairman Chiang's armies started knocking at his door however, he was able to secure his position - becoming Chairman under the banner of the Kuomintang. \n\nMuch like every warlord, he has had his fair share of corruption and misuse of authority. His frequent usage of extortion and exorbitant taxes have allowed him to rule, much more akin to a Kingpin than a Governor. Not to mention his insatiable lust for the criminal underworld, using it as a conduit for illegal wealth through the Treaty Ports, selling opium, antiques, and other luxury goods and property, to his most favorite clients, the Italians. One would think he would be open to any negotiation. \n\nHowever, despite his criminal nature, it seems General Yulin has a nationalist side. After being offered riches beyond his wildest dreams, and a permanent rule over Rehe, he has refused every offer we have handed to him. An unfortunate setback, but no matter. The General, along with the entire Northeastern Army, will be destroyed and all his riches shall become ours."

Seems that our previous protests against the last incursion have brought the Army officials to Toyko, seeking Imperial approval.

 JAP_Nekka_Incident.10.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Stunning news just released by the Imperial General Headquarters (IGH) today, as the IJA and the IJN have released details of the seemingly unknown Operation Nekka.\n\nA two-stage plan that involves taking the strategic Manchurian territories of Rehe and the Great Wall, it seems that the operation has been a great success. Minimal losses of life from our own soldiers, while heavy casualties upon the Chinese forces, have only bolstered spirits.\n\nStating the superiority of Japanese weaponry and military doctrine, this is a historical moment in Japan's quest to liberate Asia from the imperial powers and their corrupt and traitorous collaborators. As Japanese soldiers march across the cities of Chengde, Chaoyang, Kailu, and other cities in the territories, they are often greeted by the local Manchu populace, celebrating their liberation and unification with their fellow Manchu brethren in the State of Manchuria.\n\nThis is a glorious day for Japan, one of many that shall come!"

 JAP_Tanggu_Truce.1.t: "A Meeting in Tientsin"
 JAP_Tanggu_Truce.1.d: "Tientsin, the city that never sleeps. Ever since the days of Unequal Treaties and Gunboat Diplomacy, the city of Tientsin was considered the gateway of Northern China to the outside world. Everything from antiquities, porcelain, even narcotics, all go through cities like Tientsin before they are injected into the Chinese market or the global economy. Of course, we are not blinded by such an opportunity.\n\nMuch like the West, the Empire has set up its own sphere of influence within the city, using it as a means for economic advancement and, if necessary, subverting the Republic from within. The treaty ports have become a haven for both conglomerates, Kempeitai personnel, and mere prospectors looking to gain wealth and gain within greater China. However, today, it serves a different purpose entirely.\n\nOne of the many perks of a Treaty Port is it's inherent neutrality, considering the many stakeholders that are often at odds with one another. With this diplomatic standing, we can easily negotiate with the Chinese, without fearing any form of intervention or unexpected outcomes between both parties. Perhaps it is time that we meet with the Nanking government, and finally put an end to these trangressions, once and for all."

The blood spilt on foreign lands was all because of this breadbaskest of Northern China, whose economic potential is profound and of great interest for Nippon. Politicians, Bureaucrats, Militarists - all see the great beauty that can be cultivated for Japan, with its vast amounts of raw materials and nearly limitless supply of cheap labor.\n\nAs such, we cannot compromise on this issue. No form of negotiation or alternative option can defeat the great Manchurian issue. Our only and final demand is this - Recognize the sovereignty of the State of Manchuria, and cease all claims within the region. Manchuria is a client state of Japan, and subverting its sovereignty is, in turn, subverting the sovereignty of Nippon...\n\n...and will be treated as such."

Of course, that is assuming that we are directly bordering them, with their troops stationed at the border, ready to attack should tensions escalate. Remove the troops however, and the border states are free real estate for us.\n\nAs such, another demand shall be presented to the Chinese delegation - a 100 kilometer DMZ extending south of the Great Wall from Beiping to Tientsin, with the Great Wall itself under our control. Japanese aircraft and military units are allowed to enter the area as a form of treaty enforcement, and a law enforcement agency called the \"Demilitarized Zone Peace Preservation Corps\" shall serve as the peacekeepers of the region."

That is the basic definition of the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies - men blinded by the past that they cannot look towards a brighter future or people who despise a superior force than they are. These bandits have been a mild annoyance, especially in pacification operations, for they are more armed and slightly better trained than other bandits.\n\nAs such, we shall include a rather secret clause into the agreement - the newly created Peace Preservation Corps must be comprised of personnel not affiliated with the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies in any shape or manner. If found to have affiliations, they are to be terminated from their position."

The Tōa Shin Chitsujo, meaning “New Order in East Asia”, is to become the Chrysanthemum Throne’s new direction in regards to its Asian "partners", the purported scope being the total liberation of the oppressed people in this corner of the World from the greed and neglect inflicted by the European colonial powers.\n\nThese newly liberated people, from China to Java, would be free to pursue their hopes, aspirations, self-determination, and prosperity in a fair and peaceful manner with complete "Sovereign" authority over themselves.\n\nThis Pan-Asiatic concept has received considerable support from the populace of the Empire. After all, it is the duty of the people of Yamato to show those lacking the civility, sophistication, and will that the Emperor imbibes us with.\n\nBehind the idealism, however, lie those who see an opportunity for Japan.\n\nMany politicians and nationalists would like to see the “unshackled” territories and people of East Asia, with their resources and capital, be used to further the ascendancy of the Rising Sun on the global stage through the utilisation of their "economic and diplomatic worth". The militarists, likewise, covet the people and materials of the region, but for fuelling the ever-growing war machine, and all the conflicts that are certain to follow it.\n\nAs such, it comes as no surprise that, in the halls of power, the New Order is slowly, but surely, transforming. For the Land of the Rising Sun is the heart of a free Asia, and its needs are the Continent’s needs, whether the people inhabiting it see it that way or not."

This has allowed us to take a far bolder and active stance on the subject of Asian liberation and self-determination, even to the point of conflict.\n\nThe oppressed people of Việt, Indonesia, and countless other Asian lands will finally be able to proudly state their heritage, national identity and fully express their national aspirations.\n\nThe Empire of Japan, as the foremost economic and military power of the region, will obviously lead the free people of Asia towards everlasting glory and prosperity. For that to happen, however, sacrifices must be made. The Sphere must act as the collective for the mutual benefits of all of its Asian members, with the Home Islands deserving the largest "benefits", appropriate to its position in this International framework. Since ours is the only force capable of challenging the Europeans, to us will most of the iron, aluminum, tungsten, and all manners of strategic goods be transported, because only we have the requisite industrial capacity to process and utilise them effectively. Japanese oversight is, then, after all, will be quite indispensable in all military affairs of our Asian "partners".\n\nPerhaps a time will come in the future when they will be capable of determining their own fate, but for now, the Emperor and his loyal subjects will guide the helpless people of East Asia into a new age."

Known as the Hirota Sangensoku, or the Three Principles by Hirota, the speech outlines three conditions for a possible foundation of cooperation between the two countries. This includes the Republic of China making a goodwill policy towards Japan, recognition and approval of Manchuria, and cooperation against Communism in outer Mongolia.\n\nThe speech is considered a high point in Hirota's career, as the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister have approved of the speech. Before becoming the Foreign Minister in 1933, Hirota was both an ambassador to the Soviet Union and the Netherlands. With world-wide recognition, the Minster could be looking to play a bigger part in the government.\n\nThe Republic of China has so far been "disappointed" by the three points, calling them one-sided towards Japan. While Hirota wishes for cooperation between the two nations rather than conflict, it's clear more diplomatic overtures will have to be arranged."

According to Hirota, warlordism and Chinese Communism threatened \"all Asian races with certain and inexorable death\" as a \"festering sore deep within the chest of Eastern Asia.\" A second military operation in China, he claimed, would be more like "heroic surgery" than an invasion.\n\nSuch a concept is intriguing because it would aid in the conflict with the Reds in the mountains and the stabilisation of Chinese territory, but it could also imply further enslavement of the Chinese people."

Since the 1920s, Germany has had a close relationship with the government of the Republic of China, led by the Kuomintang. After the Nazi Party took power, Germany maintained its good relationship with the Chinese government, but also increasingly began courting us as well. Germany's expectation has been for Japan to be an eastern counterweight against the Soviet Union, a role we are not necessarily so welcoming of. For Germany, it seems, any armed conflict between China and Japan is very unwelcome.\n\nThough we have no current plans to invade the Soviet Union, the fact remains that the Soviets exist as an existential threat to not only ourselves, but all nations in Asia. Our war with China is just and important, however, if we were able to put this conflict on hold with some concessions for ourselves in the meantime, it would strengthen us while giving us time to prepare for a second offensive into China or to defend against possible Soviet incursion if they take issue with our actions in East Asia.\n\nWe’ll gauge China's receptiveness to such a proposal by tentatively accepting Germany’s proposal with some territorial demands for Japan. The decision now is how we ask to take in these negotiations. Asking for too much might collapse talks, but too little and there may not be enough gain to justify our expenditure in this war."

Such action could very well fracture China’s relative unity against us.\n\nRegardless, our position has been strengthened, even if there are those in government who argue that believe concessions gained were insufficient to compensate for the expenditure of manpower and resources pursuing the previous offensive into China.

Without them, our country would be subject to foreign domination and invasion. Thus, the army must receive the support it needs to continue acting as the guardian of the Empire. Yet, as of late, it seems that politicians in Tokyo no longer adhere to this way of thinking.\n\nIncreasingly, soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army have taken note of the shoddiness of their own equipment. Meanwhile, the Imperial Japanese Navy comes out with newer and ever-larger ships year after year. Army transports on the ground are hardly given enough fuel to get from point A to B, while the navy is sending their vessels across the Pacific and back regularly.\n\nSoldiers and officers alike have even begun to openly question this apparent favoritism on the part of the current administration, some even fielding questionable and potentially even treasonous solutions to this issue.

But most pivotally, our strongest line of defense against the outside world has been the ocean which separates us from the Eurasian mainland.

The homeland cannot be protected, our commerce secured, nor our foreign policy goals attained. Despite this, politicians in Tokyo have continued to pursue a policy of favoring the army over the navy. Funds dedicated to securing our waters are going towards ensuring that army Generals have a large enough salary instead.\n\nSailors and naval officers alike have taken to open criticisms of the current regime, some of which is potentially treasonous in nature.

Clearly, ceding to all of these demands would be impossible, not to mention cripplingly destabilizing for Japan.\n\nThat said, if we don’t address at least some of these grievances on the part of the Army, more battalions likely will follow in the mutineers footsteps.

Most commonly, arguments center around either the lack of equipment and food or the quality therein. Some of these excuses have reached ridiculous extremes, with one battalion commander even arguing that his unit could not move unless they received higher-quality boots.\n\nThese borderline insubordinate actions are likely caused by the growing enmity between the army and government in Tokyo, with many soldiers and officers holding favoritism for the IJN.

The government would prefer not to have this interservice rivalry spill into public life, or worse, god forbid, for the public to get involved in this discourse.\n\nThe current stopgap solution has been to require officer supervision at all times while in uniform, including at bars and other popular locations where the two parties could meet. However, as the officers themselves become more involved in this rivalry, this solution may become ineffective. Ultimately, we should hope to begin mending this rivalry before the situation deteriorates any further. "

This has also led to disobedience in these branches when they believe their side has lost favour with the government. This appears to have happened yet again.\n\nThere have been reports of severe breakdowns in Army discipline. Several Imperial soldiers are seen assaulting their superiors, refusing orders, and even deserting their battalions. This heinous behaviour has also demoralised their military colleagues, resulting in a worsening of overall military performance.

It seems that we have managed to counteract this with increased disciplinary action from above in case of failure, encouraging said crews to work harder at improving their skills. However, it also seems to be building a sort of resentment towards the current administration. Compounded with support from the admirals, many of whom are upset over the IJN’s seemingly reduced political power in government, the sailors have committed to ever more treasonous talk.\n\nAs long as this imbalance of power and funding exists between the Army and Navy, we will see resentment and drawbacks build.

As the navy currently stands, it is not well equipped for warfare against another significant naval power.\n\nIt is very likely that the root cause of this issue is the great tension that has accumulated between our army and navy military branches over the past few years. Many within the navy, both high up and rank and file believe that the army is getting preferential treatment over the navy, receiving more funding and more of a say in government and war planning. The reaction to this for some has been in part a general sense of apathy towards their duties, not training well or performing as exceptionally as they should. For others, however, their reaction has been downright radical or treasonous, some even floating talks of armed resistance or a coup.\n\nThis state of affairs must be resolved, and preferably in a timely manner.

 JAP_Expansion_Choice.1.d: "Japan finds herself surrounded by those that are her enemies that would threaten the way of the samurai. These enemies have one thing Japan desperately needs: Natural resources. The Japanese Empire lacks these critical and necessary materials at the home front to do anything from manufacturing to construction to war production. Much planning has taken place, and there are places to expand further in the north.\n\nOur first target was Manchuria. A good start, seeing that Manchuria has an abundance of resources and the Chinese government’s precarious control made it vulnerable to us. Using an incident, we sent the IJA there and briefly conquered the region in a short time. A real success it is, and a start to something bigger. Secondly, we can expand from Manchuria to Mongolia. Mongolia has plenty of resources, and establishing control over there would give us a wider array and a wider front to invade China or Russia from it.\n\nAnd then there are the Soviets. They inhabit the vastness and richness of Siberia, and are at our door. We‘ll wage a great struggle against Bolshevism if we have to, and if we invade the Far East, the natural wealth and resources will be the grand reward. Our reward after finally ending Bolshevism. But, Russia may be too vast and too big to defeat and this in itself may make our plans backfire.\n\nOn the other hand, we could look towards the south of Japan and see the western colonies and China. The Dutch East Indies contain an abundance of oil and rubber, being very plentiful in resources, along with China almost being just as vast and rich, but divided internally by warlords. We can utilize this by invading China to have a gateway to the Indonesian riches, but this would come at a severe cost of rewriting entire plans that took so long to prepare."

We’ll need them for Japan to oust the Westerners.\n\nWe have invaded a region before: Manchuria. This region doesn't have oil or rubber, but the abundance of steel, aluminium, and any resource similar allows us to wield the material to build and further develop weapons of war. But Manchuria is a stepping stone to something greater: The Dutch East Indies.\n\nIt’s no wonder why the Europeans colonized the places they did: They’re usually rich in rubber and oil. But there are a few obstacles in our way. The first one is China. China lies between French Indochina and our puppet state in Manchuria, and China’s ambition would eventually pose a threat to our rule in Manchuria. The second one is the Western Powers themselves, but who cares about them? What can they do but watch?\n\nIf we have secured our rule over China, or at least, a part of it, we can move our eyes towards the real reward: Indonesia. Our forces will land first in Indochina via sea and maybe land if possible. After consolidating control in Indochina military-wise, we strike key points in Indonesia with naval landings, while the cooperation from the air force and military facilitate air-to-ground support and paratrooper landings. Should we be successful, we would be a step closer to Japanese dominance over our enemies and possibly East-Asia.\n\nAnother route is Siberia and Mongolia. Controlled by the Soviet Union, these resources would be better suited under the banner of the Rising Sun, rather than in the accursed hands of the godless Bolsheviks!\n\n...But we’ll have to redraw plans and that will be a huge hassle with an severe cost."

Compared to our Imperial Navy, theirs is an insignificant obstacle to our objective. The presence of coastal artillery and warplanes, however, could prove to be a delaying factor that together with their navy could give them time to reinforce the city and significantly hinder our plans.\n\nTo avoid such a humiliating situation, a devastating attack must take place to neutralize any chance of resistance on the water or in the air. The 2nd Fleet, our mobile naval force, will engage the numerically inferior Pacific Fleet and sink it to the bottom of the sea. The air forces of the Imperial Navy will assist in the ensuing battle while at the same time destroying the airbases and coastal artillery present in and around Vladivostok, along with its industrial complex.\n\nSecrecy is key for the complete success of Operation Transamur.

The 2nd Fleet is ready to strike the Soviet Pacific Fleet at a moment’s notice. The Navy’s air force is prepared to decimate together with our ships the enemy vessels, along with all the airfields, defences and factories of Vladivostok.

Aided by the darkness of a moonless night and the lack of radio communication, a Japanese fleet of heavy and light cruisers, along with a significant number of destroyers and a large contingent of warplanes, silently crossed the Sea of Japan and reached the home of the Pacific Fleet.\n\nSince most of the sailors and officers were asleep at the moment of the attack, a majority of our ships were unable to function at full capacity and thus were easy targets for the combined firepower of the enemy fleet and air force. While a part of the coastal artillery was manned and did manage to inflict damage to some of the Japanese vessels, their resistance was silenced by the deafening sound of the Imperial Air Force’s bombers precisely targeting many of their positions. Air bases were likewise destroyed, many of the fighters capable of putting up a fight in the skies being either ruined or tied to the ground by a lack of lanes from which to take off. The numerous factories of the city were then targeted, a significant number being outright destroyed.\n\nAs the sun rose and the onslaught ceased, all that was left of our naval presence in the Far East was a wreckage spanning the entire Vladivostok harbour.\n\nGeneral Secretary [SOV.GetLeader] was woken up only minutes after information regarding the disaster reached the Kremlin.

By the time the Soviets became aware of the impending attack it was too late for them to put up any significant resistance, with Vladivostok’s harbour having entered into the range of our ships’ guns. A raging fire soon started, the Pacific Fleet’s crews watching helplessly as most of their vessels became nothing more than burning wreckages, slowly sinking to the bottom of the port’s shallow waters along with any of the men unfortunate enough to be trapped on them.\n\nThe defensive capabilities of the city posed no problems. The coastal artillery scattered in and around Vladivostok, partially manned as it was, managed to inflict only minor damage to some of our vessels. Their activity was eventually halted by our bombers turning their positions into smoldering craters. Any potential ability of the scant Soviet air force to contest our air supremacy and deter the destruction that was unfolding disappeared as their air bases became nothing more than ruins, incapable of allowing the pilots to take off with those few fighters that managed to escape the rain of steel and fire. Much of the industrial complex was also destroyed, hindering any Bolshevik attempt at repairing or producing military equipment.\n\nThe surprise night attack on Port Arthur over three decades ago marked the ascendancy of the Yamato people on the world stage.

The Japanese started the war in the same way they did in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905, most likely for pragmatic reasons or to humiliate the USSR.\n\nIt remains to be seen who will emerge victorious from this conflict.

Because of its importance as a trade hub, the Imperial High Command declared Magadan to be a point of "great strategic importance" that should be captured as soon as possible, both to significantly weaken Soviet access to the Pacific and to secure our supply lines for further advances into Siberia.\n\nTo ensure that Magadan can continue to serve as the main logistical hub for our war against the Soviets, it is critical that the port and its facilities remain operational and free of Soviet sabotage, which would render an assault over land and subsequent siege of the city impossible.\n\nThe Imperial Navy has thus proposed a plan for an amphibious attack against the city, which will secure control over the town with minimal damage to the port and low casualties.\n\nThe plan calls for a Special Marine Landing Force to attack the port at night, overrun the outmanned garrison, and then secure and reinforce the port against enemy counterattacks. Meanwhile, the Navy would begin shelling Magadan's interior to disrupt Soviet counterattacks, while reinforcements would land in the port to relieve the Marines and conquer the rest of the city.

 JAP_Panay_Incident.4.d: "The American ambassador, Nelson T. Johnson, has brought us very good news. Following the destruction of the USS Panay by a Japanese bombing attack, the United States has decided to declare war on Japan and assist us in finally defeating the warmonger Hirohito. Given how the war has not progressed in our favour, with the loss of key cities across our nation, this assistance is much appreciated and could provide us with the forces we require to turn the tide of this war. All we have to do now is hold the line until American forces arrive, at which point we can launch a counteroffensive, driving the Japanese out of our homeland and reclaiming our lost cities.\n\nThe Japanese most likely believed that the war would be over soon. Now we'll show them that the war is just getting started. We will take their cities as they have taken ours. Along with our American allies, we will march to Tokyo and pay Emperor Hirohito a visit to demonstrate the Dragon's might."

We would have gone to war with the US anyway, but this war came much sooner than we would have liked, and we are unprepared. While we expected a reaction from the US, few anticipated such an aggressive response.\n\nAll we can do now is fight to the death, mobilise the entire Imperial Japanese Navy, and hope that it will be enough to push the Eagle back on one side and finish off the Dragon on the other. If we can accomplish this, we may still have a chance to win this war. If not, and the Japanese Empire is doomed to fall, so be it. But we will not give up without a fight, and our spirits will not be broken because the Emperor, a divine being, is still with us. Banzai, Tennheika!"

If we do not deliver an apology, the sleeping Giant's response is uncertain, with the worst-case scenario being the severance of diplomatic ties and a war on two fronts; a war for which we are not yet prepared.\n\nOn the other hand, an apology could make us appear weak on the international stage, as if we are cowering before the US, which our enemies and future enemies, both internal and external, could exploit.\n\nWhatever we decide, we must be cautious and deliberate in our next steps, as this decision will shape the future of the Japanese Empire and our relations with the United States."

Japan has decided to give in to our demands and assigned Vice Admiral Rokuzo Sugiyama, Chief of Staff of the IJN 3rd Fleet, to make an apology. In this apology it is stated that their pilots never saw any American flags on the Panay. Furthermore, they admit that one navy plane launched a machine gun attack on a boat and that Japanese army motor boats launched attacks on Chinese steamers escaping upstream on the opposite bank. They, however, maintain that the attack was unintentional. Finally, they apologise for the accident and hope that Japan and the United States can maintain good relations.\n\nOur ambassador to Japan, Joseph C. Grew, and several other government officials are relieved that this crisis was able to be resolved diplomatically, and they commend us for remaining calm and resolving the situation diplomatically. Some, however, believe that we were too soft and that the victims of the Panay Incident were not properly avenged. Furthermore, some believe that the incident was planned and that it will only be a matter of time before Japan declares war on us, arguing that we should have taken advantage of the opportunity and attacked Japan while they were busy with the Chinese.\n\nOnly time will tell if we have made the right decision, but for now this crisis is over and ended in a victory for the United States."

Our request appears to have been ignored, and we will not receive an apology from Tokyo. The Japanese, it appears, are not interested in resolving this crisis diplomatically, preferring to have bad relations and sever diplomatic ties rather than apologise.\n\nEven though we did not receive the apology we desired, this does provide us with information about Japan's intentions and future plans. They clearly do not want to work with us, so we must brace ourselves for the inevitable. Our Pacific islands are now more vulnerable than ever, as this is most likely just the beginning of a large-scale conflict with the Japanese Empire. Unless Japan sends an apology, we can expect more conflict and, eventually, a full-fledged war. A war for which we must prepare.\n\nClearly, our citizens are outraged, believing that the government is incompetent and has failed to properly resolve this crisis, and they are demanding vengeance for the innocent lives lost in the Panay Incident. The Japanese may have avoided punishment for the time being, but..."

 JAP_Oil_Embargo.1.t: "Japanese Ambitions in Indochina"
 JAP_Oil_Embargo.1.d: "Mr. President, we have received information confirming that the Japanese Empire is currently occupying the entire former French colony of Indochina.\n\nChinese forces have been importing supplies from the French through Indochina to aid them in their war against Japan. As such, the Empire of the Rising Sun initiated negotiations with the government in Vichy. They demanded naval basing rights, control over airbases, the right to transit troops, and the closure of the border with China. Although in the end, the French accepted the demands, Japanese soldiers slipped out of control and conflict broke out.\n\nAfter a few days, they regained authority over their troops. The result of the incident was the Japanese occupation of Northern Indochina. The Southern part only seized recently, likely in preparation for a potential invasion of Indonesia. Although all of French Indochina is now under Japanese supervision, the colonial soldiers and civil administration were allowed to remain.\n\nIt is now apparent, the Empire of the Rising Sun has no limits. They will continue to cause bloodshed throughout Asia until someone stops them. More and more people in our cabinet suggest we place an oil embargo on Japan. Such a sanction would certainly cripple their war effort, as they import most of their fuel from the States. With this, we may stop their warmongering without any of our soldiers having to die. It must also be pointed out, Mr. President, that they undoubtedly won't take this too kindly, we should be prepared for armed retaliation."

 JAP_Oil_Embargo.2.d: "The United States of America has imposed an oil embargo in retaliation for our recent liberation of Indochina.\n\nThis isn't the first time the US has punished us: they've already stopped selling us scrap metal and cut us off from the Panama Canal. Despite the fact that a lack of metal hampered our war production, we continued on with our great crusade. However, these sanctions pale in comparison to the oil embargo.\n\nFuel was our most crucial import from the US, as such, the importance of this sanction cannot be understated. Without it, our machines of liberation cannot run for long. We desperately have to find another source of oil as soon as possible.\n\nWhile the prosperous Dutch East Indies seem promising, the Navy is certain that any attempts to seize it would bring the USA into the war. In the end, we are left with two choices: acquire Indonesia before our reserves run out or submit to the Americans."

 JAP_Pearl_Harbor.1.t: "Slaying the Giant"
 JAP_Pearl_Harbor.1.d: "The war room buzzed with quiet activity as Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto prepared to open the meeting. But how does one open a meeting on a subject this vitally important and dangerous? An operation of this scale and magnitude is clearly not something to consider frivolously. Admiral Yamamoto knew that well, it was why he demanded to be the one to plan it, even going so far as to threaten resignation should he not get approval to.\n\nYamamoto may have been against attacking the United States, but he knew he was also the admiral with the most knowledge of the United States and their capabilities. He hadn’t spent time on Japan’s diplomatic team to the US, as well as time at Harvard, for nothing. Thus he was aware of just how much of a power imbalance existed between their two countries, and just how much this attack had to go perfectly if Japan wanted to survive the coming war. If this opening attack did not cripple a large portion of the American Pacific Fleet out of the gate, there would be no hope for a rapid successful conclusion to the war.\n\nBefore him stood the three men whom he believed most qualified to plan this operation. Rear Admiral Ryūnosuke Kusaka, Captain Minoru Genda and Yamamoto's own Deputy Chief of Staff, Captain Kameto Kuroshima. He knew each of these men well, and had served with each one of them first-hand on the open seas. None of them were blinded by inane nationalism to the realities a war with the United States would entail. In the end, his opening remark would end up curt and to the point.\n\n“Gentlemen, we all know our duty to Japan. Let us begin.”"

 JAP_Pearl_Harbor.2.t: "An Illustrious Example"
 JAP_Pearl_Harbor.2.d: "Technological advancement has changed the ways in which war has been waged immensely over the past 40 years. This is something Yamamoto is acutely aware of, being a military man himself, privy to how technology has written and rewritten time and time again the rules of war on the battlefield. The field of naval warfare is no different, and nowhere can this be seen more acutely than the relatively recent raid at Taranto, Italy.\n\nThe Royal Navy utilized the naval air wing of their fleet to devastating effect on the Italians, whose battle fleet of the Regia Marina had been anchored at port in Taranto. Despite the shallowness of the water, the British decided to attack using dozens of aerial torpedoes. Ultimately, the attack was a total success on Great Britain’s part, allowing them to disable half of all the battleships moored in the port, and several other smaller ships. To date, there has not yet been an example as clear as this that the age of big gun ships is over.\n\nOur assistant naval attaché to Berlin, Lieutenant Commander Takeshi Naito, flew south to Taranto to study the aftermath of the raid, and to discuss with Italian naval commanders how precisely the attack was executed. This raid will serve as an operative basis of how to execute a large-scale port strike. If we wish to decommission a large part of the American navy at port in Pearl Harbor, it is through air power that we shall do it."
 JAP_Pearl_Harbor.2.A: "An interesting case study"

 JAP_Pearl_Harbor.3.t: "Undersea Spears"
 JAP_Pearl_Harbor.3.d: "“You can’t be serious,” asked Captain Minoru Genda, “Those submarines have a questionable record at best. Not to mention we’ll be in shallow water, making them much more easily detectable. Not only would bringing them along be a waste of effort, it would actively detract from the battle as a whole!”\n\n“You underestimate the utility these submarines could add to this battle,” responded Captain Kameto Kuroshima, “While the American fleet is focused on the aerial attack, the undersea attack will go unnoticed, allowing for a much more overall effective raid on their Pacific fleet.”\n\nYamamoto rubbed his forehead as he listened to the two argue back and forth. They had been arguing the merits of including submarines in the attack for over a week, and in that time had dressed up mountains of files and reports on the effectiveness of submarines in a variety of conditions. The argument always circled back to the same few points. On the one hand, including submarines in a shallow water attack could give away the attack prematurely and submarines might be ineffective in the undersea terrain of Pearl Harbor, however having a two pronged undersea and aerial attack might also divide the American Fleet’s attention and allow for the attack to be overall more devastating with the Americans in disarray.\n\nIt is a valid argument to have, but Yamamoto is keenly aware that planning needs to continue on schedule, and the submarine issue is taking altogether too much time. They needed to be ready for the upcoming practice runs at Hokkaido, and needed to inform the fleet what units and materials to prepare for the attack. Without a consensus from his subordinates, it seems he will simply have to bite the bullet and make the command decision now."

 JAP_Pearl_Harbor.4.d: "Inconclusive. Yamamoto sighed again as he heard the word from his junior officer on deck before him. It seemed to be the word of the day. The practice runs the fleet has been performing in Hokkaido have thus far been going excellently, fleets positioning themselves well and air squadrons flying in tight precision. Unfortunately, a pivotal question remains as practices continue for the attack. The question of whether Japan ought to embark on a third attack wave during the coming raid on Pearl Harbor, or leave it be after the second.\n\nExisting reports about such attacks are inconclusive as they are rare, as are the wargames and exercises we’ve embarked upon in our attempts to solve the question. A third wave could potentially be a great way to push the Japanese advantage during the attack, giving the IJN the ability to inflict even more damage on the American Pacific Fleet and take out even more military targets than before. Alternatively, however, if the Americans manage to organize before the third wave, it could allow them to go on the offensive counterattack, which could bring devastating losses to the fleet.\n\nYamamoto felt questioning eyes from behind him as he looked out from the deck from the Akagi. He knew that a decision had to be made during these practice runs so that when the time came, the fleet could effectively execute the plan given to them. Having come to a decision and crafted the right words, he turned and spoke."

Those who walked by might have wondered what he was drawing. The sunset, perhaps? Maybe a nice landscape picture of the beautiful Hawaiian shore? Whatever it was, he must have been fascinated, as he had sat on the bench for several hours looking out towards the water.\n\nIn reality, Takeo Yoshikawa’s intentions were not so pure. In his notebook, he had drawn a map of Pearl Harbor, in fact several. Above each one was time of day, and on each map, so carefully drawn, were small ships, each meticulously labelled and named. Every time a ship came into or left the harbor, he would draw a pocket watch from his breast pocket, note the time, and jot down what ship came into the harbor to be moored, or what ship undocked and sailed out to open sea. All of this information compiled into one neat little report.\n\nIn a few days, he would find his way into the small Japanese consulate in Hawaii. From there he would make his way into the back room where the Japanese consulate housed its Type B Cipher Machine. Just as he had for several weeks previously, and as he would continue for the foreseeable future, he would input his twice weekly report to be transmitted across the pacific for the eyes of one Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto. Of course, Takeo Yoshikawa didn’t know who was reading these reports, or even exactly for what purpose he made those reports. However, it wasn’t his job to know."

 JAP_Pearl_Harbor.6.t: "Pearl's Table Scraps"
 JAP_Pearl_Harbor.6.d: "As Yamamoto read the proposal, he couldn’t help but get chills at the implications of it. On his desk lay a proposal for the total, or as close to it as they could get with a naval air fleet, destruction of Pearl Harbor. Specifically, the proposal calls for a bombing run targeting not the American navy itself, but the infrastructure that supports it at Pearl Harbor. According to the plan, the port, infrastructure including roads and rail, and fuel reserves located on the island are all to be targeted.\n\nThe justification for the plan is that by diverting navy resources, namely one of the air fleets originally meant to participate in the targeting of American Pacific Fleet ships, to the aim of destroying or significantly reducing the utility of the Pearl Harbor port, the IJN could save resources long term by forcing the US’ invest some of their own resources in rebuilding the port. While conceptually Yamamoto did not object to the idea, the idea of taking out American strategic assets that is, however the idea that the war might last long enough for an action like this to have a long term impact was disquieting.\n\nUltimately, it would be a risky proposition that might take away from the main mission this attack is intended for, which is disabling as much of the American Pacific Fleet as possible. However, in the event this war takes longer to end than is initially desirable, it might be a good idea to start targeting American infrastructure early. "

New naval fighter and torpedo bombers fresh out of the factory being loaded onto the carriers, large fuel tankers draining their oil into even larger fuel tanks aboard the battleships and destroyers, shells and ammunition being brought on in large crates to be stored below deck. Yamamoto reflected it must be a similar story at every major port in Japan right now, as not only was Japan about to engage the United States in war by attacking Pearl Harbor, but Great Britain as well as Japan prepared to launch a full assault on Britain's Southeast Asian colonies.\n\nYamamoto had lived too long and was too intimately familiar with the inner workings of the Japanese government to be blinded by nationalism. He knew the coming war would be difficult. If Japan did not execute the coming operations with perfect precision, Japan would be lost, perhaps permanently, under foreign rule and occupation. He had spent time enough in the United States to understand the kind of threat they could pose. Industrially, technologically, and militarily, the United States was every bit as capable as Japan, and by some metrics, far superior.\n\nYamamoto took a deep breath and turned to walk back to his office. He had to believe Japan could do this perfectly. By the will of the Emperor they had to! He couldn’t afford to imagine an alternative. Nobody could.

From his vantage point he could see the whole of his crew on the Akagi working diligently. The torpedo bombers were fuelled and ready to launch on his command. All he was waiting for was the order to go through with the attack.\n\nThe air of the ship was one of anticipation. A silent feeling of excitement, perhaps? A kind of prolepsis for the battle to come? Whatever it was, Hasagawa felt it too. He and his men were about to engage one of the world's major powers in naval combat, take part in the opening salvoes of a war that would surely be greater than any that Japan has ever fought before. While he was sure Japan would be victorious, he was not so foolish as to believe that the coming conflict would be an easy venture.\n\nOverhead Hasegawa saw seagulls flying, and diving for fish.

Normally by now they would have been on their way to breakfast, but their company’s breakfast truck was late.\n\n“You know how those bozos are. They’re always late. Best thing we can do is just keep practicing with the radar.

George immediately grabbed for the telephone to call high command.\n\n“This is Opana Radar Site, we have incoming bogies coming from the north. Please advise?” The telephone line gently crackled as the duo awaited a response, before a voice sounded back over the phone.\n\n“Please disregard, Opana Radar.”\n\n“Sir, I’ve never seen so many incoming before, are you sure?” The line went silent once again. Two minutes later a new voice came over the radio.\n\n“This is Lieutenant Tyler, repeat your report Opana Radar”. The private relayed the information about unexpected incoming bogies once more. Following a brief moment of silence on the other side, the Lieutenant responded.\n\nDon’t worry Opana Radar. It’s nothing.” With that, the line went dead.

In this, however, Japan has failed. While deciding to pursue an attack at Pearl Harbor was conceptually a good idea, we did not dedicate the resources or take the actions requisite to knock out the American pacific fleet docked at Pearl Harbor.\n\nWhile our torpedo bombers did manage to score some damage against the unsuspecting American fleet, but without additional undersea support, or more waves to ensure further damage, or even simply plans for knocking out the port’s logistic capabilities, the American Pacific Fleet has been left almost fully operational. As we speak, the Americans have already almost fully reorganized their fleet docked in Hawaii and are repairing a good deal of the damage we dealt against them.\n\nThe plans made for the coming war against the United States were in large part contingent on the idea that America’s ability to exert power in the Pacific would be if not crippled then at least delayed long enough for us to shore up our defence and seize the British territories necessary to ensure the natural resources necessary to see this war to a victorious end were secured.

Surely, this glorious victory will be a fantastic propaganda piece for the newspapers back home.\n\nAs for the situation in the Pacific, it stands now about as opportune as it may ever get. With the American Pacific fleet damaged as it is, we have gained valuable time to shore up our defences in the Pacific and seize as many American and British strategic territories important for the war effort as possible. By the time the Americans are ready to begin engaging us once more, we will be more than prepared for anything they might throw our way.\n\nThe only immediate threat remaining for us is the British fleet. However, given that Great Britain’s focus appears to primarily be on Europe right now, they may not have the time or resources to bring in a fleet to defend against the attacks we have planned in the coming weeks.

While we did manage to destroy a good portion of the American fleet based at Hawaii, the Americans managed to organize themselves during the third wave of our attack against their base, managing to figure out where the Kido Butai was and counterattack it directly.\n\nTheir counterattack, while not devastating as that which we inflicted on them, was still very costly, losing us 2 Destroyers, and 1 Aircraft Carrier. That in addition to all the losses of fighters and submarines expended during the attack on Pearl Harbor itself has left us with about 700 casualties total. The damage sustained by other members of the Kido Butai fleet was minimal, though the loss of an aircraft carrier will surely reduce the effectiveness of this naval group.\n\nThough the attack was not as successful as it might have been, the fact remains that it for the most part accomplished its mission, which was knocking out the American Pacific Fleet. No doubt the Americans are already reorganizing and scraping together another fleet with whatever they have nearby, which makes it imperative that we take the time afforded to us by this attack to the fullest.

Including casualties taken at Pearl Harbor, the death toll stands right now at around 2500. As the reports of heavy fighting flashed into the White House, London reported semi-officially that the British Empire would carry out Prime Minister Winston Churchill's pledge to give the United States full support in case of hostilities with Japan.\n\nPresident Roosevelt has ordered the country and the Army and Navy onto a full war footing, and has arranged at a White House conference last night to address a joint session of Congress at noon today, presumably to ask for declaration of a formal state of war.

 JAP_Surrender.1.t: "The Terms of Surrender"
 JAP_Surrender.1.d: "A few weeks ago, the Empire of Japan officially surrendered. Following this important news, General Douglas MacArthur has been sent to the Pacific to organise an important ceremony between the Allied powers, which include British, French, Dutch, Chinese, Soviets and, of course, Americans officials. The ceremony takes place on the USS Missouri, one of the last ships built before the end of the war.\n\n“Dear friends, dear allies, I thank you all for coming aboard today, to what we can surely call the end of hostilities in Asia and Pacific for the coming decades!”\nApplause erupts from the side of the diplomats, while all the soldiers stand at attention\n\n“We have, all together, passed the last months to discuss how we could decide on the issue of the Japanese defeat. If we need to pursue  discussions about Manchuria and Korea, it seems we’re all depending on the territories of Japan proper!”\n\n“First, it has been decided that the Japanese archipelago will become an occupied zone, under the command of the Supreme Commander of Allied Powers. Second, Taiwan and some islands will be given to the Chinese government. Finally, the South Sakhalin and the Kirill islands will be placed under Soviet authority.”\n\n“Thanks for this quick summary, General de Hauteclocque. And now, to officially end this war, please, bring in the Japanese delegation.”"
 JAP_Surrender.1.A: "The corpse of the empire lays before us, a beast now vanquished."

 JAP_Surrender.2.t: "A Return to the Old?"
 JAP_Surrender.2.d: "After the final capitulation of the Japanese Empire, our diplomats have finally managed to take back our colonies in the Far-East. Malaya, Borneo and Burma are under British control again. Finally.\n\nBut the downside to this is the increase in resistance to our occupation. In the old days, there were not that many in this region, but the invasion and the liberation of these territories by the Japanese have excited the desires for independence.\n\nDay after day, the reports that come to us from the region requested more and more soldiers and even more firepower to restore control over the cities. The situation is so catastrophic that some even fear the emergence of nationalist or communist uprisings, and the governor-generals of the region all have trouble, asking the King and the Prime Minister to intervene, as unifying figures, thus restoring order over the Empire once and for all.\n\nOn the other hand, some have asked about the possibilities of giving some new liberties to the local population, arguing that this will probably calm the agitators.\n\nWhile no one can say what will be our future in the region, it is clear the return to the old order will not be an easy task."
 JAP_Surrender.2.A: "The Empire will face the situation, whatever the price."

 JAP_Surrender.3.t: "A Different Indochina"
 JAP_Surrender.3.d: "A few days ago, the Liberation Committee of France finally regained control over the territories of Indochina, after months of fighting in Southern Asia and the capitulation of Japan.\n\nThe situation of Laos and Cambodia are running smoothly, with the local populations having warmly cheered the return of the French forces; on the other hand, the situation in Vietnam is more complex. In fact, the communist agitator in the region, Ho Chi Minh, has seized power in a few locations, leading to even more conflict in the region.\n\nThe colonial forces have called on the French government to send them more men and guns in order to maintain order over Indochina. Some volunteers have even left the French mainland to help their Asian brothers.\n\nLike in the British colonial territories in the region, the French Far-East territories face a crossroad of uncertainty."
 JAP_Surrender.3.A: "The government needs to reorganise the situation in the region, and quickly."

 JAP_Surrender.4.t: "Reclaiming China"
 JAP_Surrender.4.d: "“There are ten more divisions surrendering here, sir. They all lowered their arms and surrendered immediately.”\n\nThis quote is now a daily one for the Chinese's commanders, as many and many more Japanese divisions are surrendering to them, gradually accepting the reality of their final defeat.\n\nFrom the orders of the Generalissimo, Chiang Kai-Shek, the troops advanced quickly around the Chinese sub-continent, and, after a few weeks, they finally entered Manchuria. If the liberation campaign is so quick, it is for a good reason: Chiang fears the communists, and he knows that the truce they have with the Chinese warlords will be short-lived after the final armistice.\n\nToday, the generals at the front have received new orders from the Generalissimo himself: “Continue to advance as much as possible. We need to capture the cities of Harbin, Hsinking and Tunghwa. Capture them quickly, and do it before the reds. All hail the Legitimate Republic!”"

 JAP_Operation_Nekka: "Operation Nekka"
 JAP_Operation_Nekka_desc: "Where the Great Wall meets the ocean, Shanhaiguan is found. Since the Boxer Rebellion, the IJA has maintained a small garrison in Shanhaiguan, which holds a position of great strategic importance, as the most valuable pass of the Great Wall, right on the historical border with the Manchurians. And to the south of Shanhaiguan lies Rehe, barely held by one of the many corrupt and rotten bandits that lord over Chinese provinces as if they were kings. \n \nUtilising the same methods used in the Manchurian Incident, plans are being set regarding the usage of false-flag tactics to seize Shanhaiguan completely for Manchuria, and to release Rehe from the ever-weakening grasp of Zhang Xueliang. Surely, if our plans were to succeed, we'd placate the Manchurian populace and further cement our indisputable dominance over northern China."
 JAP_Lytton_Report: "The Lytton Report"
 JAP_Lytton_Report_desc: "Following the Mukden Incident, China, while undergoing massive social upheaval and unrest in their mainland, issued protests against our actions in the League of Nations, much to our chagrin. Our great diplomats were successful in foiling Chinese demands and stalling negotiations as much as possible, going as far as to make said negotiations fall off completely, cementing Japanese hegemony in East Asia, with nobody to diplomatically protest, save for the USA. \n \nHowever, Victor Bulwer-Lytton, a British politician and colonial administrator, has left Shanghai after several months of investigation, having compiled a report that supposedly defies our claim that what happened in Mukden was an act of self-defense."
 JAP_Negotiate_with_the_Dragon: "Negotiate with the Serpent"
 JAP_Negotiate_with_the_Dragon_desc: "After the full victory at Rehe and Shanhaiguan, minor border skirmishes are the norm in the new Manchu frontier. Given the pitiful state of China, being marred in a never-ending civil war against the Communists and the lack of international support, we are in a perfect position to demand the total withdrawal of the remaining Kuomintang border troops, in order to form a demilitarised zone. The Chinese will also acknowledge that Manchuria is a legitimate state, and that Rehe is a core part of it, whether they like it or not. \n \nBesides creating an opportunity for newfound peace in the region, these negotiations will also improve Manchuria's standing in the international sphere, given that the Western powers continue to refuse to acknowledge its sovereignty."
 JAP_Manchuria_Triumphant: "Triumph in Manchuria!"
 JAP_Manchuria_Triumphant_desc: "With the success of Operation Nekka, Manchuria is now fully whole. From Heilongjiang to Liaoning, Japanese rule over the Northeast is unquestioned, unchallenged, and the Manchurian people are finally freed from the yoke of Chinese imperialism and moral degeneration. \n \nA matter of great national prestige, the Manchurian invasion and following conflicts proved to be extremely popular in the mainland, while solidifying the status of Japan as a liberating force for the peoples of Asia. Such as the Manchus were freed from warlords and banditry, one day, all of Asia will be too!"
 JAP_Preserve_the_NUC: "The National Unity Cabinet"
 JAP_Preserve_the_NUC_desc: "After the assassination of Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi following an attempted coup d'état carried out by reactionary elements of the Imperial Navy and right-wing civilian groups, the state of rule of law and democracy in Japan is fragile at best, with militarism now widespread following the conquest of Manchuria. \n \nThe influence of nationalist groups is constantly rising in the army and navy, and small communist cells have also gained prominence. In order to keep the government running, radical influence, be it fascist or communist, must be curved and swiftly removed from the Emperor's cabinet."
 JAP_The_Nihon_Lifeline: "The Nippon Lifeline"
 JAP_The_Nihon_Lifeline_desc: "The conquest of Manchuria, while a matter of national pride, also has an extremely important role in fueling the Japanese war machine and economy. Manchuria is seen as a crucial asset, an economic lifeline, that will help drag Japan out of the pit that is the Great Depression. \n \nHowever at the moment, Manchuria as a whole is underdeveloped, plagued by rural banditry and crumbling infrastructure - save for the South Manchurian Railway. \n \nThis territory possesses great deposits of minerals that are fundamental to any growing empire such as ours, like steel, coal, and arable land. The development of these lands and exploitation of these deposits, followed by the binding of Manchuria to Japan is vital to the success of the empire, and as such, must be pursued as soon as possible."
 JAP_A_Common_Goal_with_Different_Methods: "A Common Goal With Different Methods"
 JAP_A_Common_Goal_with_Different_Methods_desc: "Following the Lytton Report and our withdrawal from the League of Nations, our state finds itself diplomatically isolated, and surrounded by enemies. The most influential politicians in the Japanese bureaucratic sphere, Shidehara Kijuro, Hirota Koki and Matsuoka Yosuke present widely different proposals regarding how our foreign policy should be handled from now on, from peace and diplomacy, to furthering the military cause. \n \nHowever, the three disparate politicians have one thing in common: that the need to cement the ascendancy of Japan as a power in East Asia, a position that the Empire has been destined to hold since the Meiji Restoration, is of paramount importance."
 JAP_Shidehara_Velvet_Glove: "Shidehara's Velvet Glove"
 JAP_Shidehara_Velvet_Glove_desc: "With the decision to follow Baron Shidehara's ideals for foreign policy, the Empire will seek rapprochement with the West, and pursue a largely non-interventionist approach to matters in China. \n \nShidehara Kijuro, having served as Minister of Foreign Affairs numerous times, is an extremely experienced figure who has always attempted to maintain good relations with Great Britain and the United States. However, his conciliatory nature must not be confused for weakness, as Shidehara will always have the best interests of Japan at the forefront of his mind, and will defend his ideals with unyielding resolve."
 JAP_Hirota_3_Principle: "Hirota's Three Principles"
 JAP_Hirota_3_Principle_desc: "With the decision to follow Hirota's ideals for foreign policy, the Empire will seek a middle ground between non-interventionism and militarism with the aim of pleasing all the parties involved. \n \nHirota Sangensoku, or The Three Principles of Hirota, will serve as the political foundation of Hirota's ideals for the Japanese Empire from now on, and will focus on the establishment of a Japan-China-Manchuria bloc, the organisation and unity of Japan and China against the rising tide of communism, the eradication of anti-Japanese activities, and the complete stamping out of warlordism and banditry in China."
 JAP_Matsuoka_Iron_Fist: "Matsuoka's Iron Fist"
 JAP_Matsuoka_Iron_Fist_desc: "With the decision to adopt Yōsuke Matsuoka's ideals for foreign policy, the Empire will adopt a saber-rattling stance and seek to fully pursue the dream of Pan-Asian unity, through force. \n \nWith the formation of an Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, the disparate peoples of Asia, from the frozen reaches of the Northeast, to the warm waters of Oceania, will be freed from the shackles of European colonialism, Chinese imperialism, and ideological and moral corruption. All of this will be achieved while cementing Japan's position at the forefront of Asian liberation and prosperity. The rising sun will shine across all of Asia soon enough"
 JAP_Fanatics_Out_Moderates_In: "Fanatics Out, Moderates In"
 JAP_Fanatics_Out_Moderates_In_desc: "The economic crisis has proved disastrous for the unity of our government, as a large number of politicians are aligning themselves with extremist views, believing them to be the solution to our problems. In these dire times, we cannot allow these waves of extremism to destroy the drifting ship that is Japan. Political fanatics, ambitious and set in their ways, pose a dangerous threat to our country, if not the Emperor and his rule itself! To combat these ideologues and prevent our Empire from being thrown off course, we’ll have to take some drastic measures, with official dismissals being possibly the lightest of them all."
 JAP_Curb_the_External_Threat: "Curb the External Threat"
 JAP_Curb_the_External_Threat_desc: "While there are many threats within our government, this does not mean there are threats outside the halls of the Diet. Revolutionaries and Reactionaries have been gaining popularity by the day, and even though certain reforms have been created to curb their spread, it is inadequate at best. If we are to prevent these extremists to take power, we must create new measures to counter them. Perhaps even using our new territory as a way to ship them out of the Japanese heartland.\n\nEither way, they must be stopped with haste."
 JAP_Handshake_with_Bureaucrats: "A Handshake With Bureaucrats"
 JAP_Handshake_with_Bureaucrats_desc: "State bureaucrats are one of the institutional pillars of our government - while the greatest minds Japan are known to sit at the top, steering the Empire out of the vortex that is radicalism, the bureaucrats at the grassroot levels make sure our directives are implemented in all of Japan.\n\nThe state cannot function without them, but with them being much closer to the common man than we are, we must not risk the state officials being the demagogues of dangerous ideologies as well. Instead of dismissing anyone not in line with us, we will encourage them to cooperate with us - destroying their siege mentality, and improving their political reliability."
 JAP_Exporting_Radicals_Abroad: "Exporting our Radicals Abroad"
 JAP_Exporting_Radicals_Abroad_desc: "Radicals, as intelligent as they are, cannot be described as unpopular. With their voices reaching millions of our citizens, dismissing them or even sentencing them to prison would turn them simply into a martyr or a soapbox, presenting themselves as poor victims of an ‘unfair government’.\n\nWhat we have in store- they don’t, it is something much simpler - by ordering the unruly officers and politicians to our colonies, we can legally keep them busy, preventing them from sowing the seeds of radicalism in the domestic bit of our military. How would they rebel against that? It is much better than simply shutting them behind prison walls, and definitely cheaper."
 JAP_In_The_Name_Kokutai: "In the Name of The Kokutai"
 JAP_In_The_Name_Kokutai_desc: "We cannot allow the political order we have built for so long to go to waste. The ‘kokutai’, a term meaning the same as ‘government’ or ‘order of things’ is our top rule, and anyone daring to reach for it to modify it shall find his hand chopped off. Stopping the people even thinking about changing the kokutai should be our top priority\n\nWith the proper protocols set in place, we will be able to secure Japan’s future and prevent it from going down the drastic, destructive paths."
 JAP_Peak_Inevitable_Slope: "The Peak's Inevitable Slope"
 JAP_Peak_Inevitable_Slope_desc: "The politics’ slope is known to cause many people to slip downhill, and that too rather fast. It also is valid for even the most prominent members of the government who dare to challenge the kokutai. \n\nSadao Araki, leader of the radical Kodoha faction knows that his time is running out, and perhaps the only way he can avoid public outrage and possible legal repercussions for his actions as a general is resigning - should we force him to do it, the Kodoha faction will finally crumble, and with it, any chance of radicalism attempting to dismantle the stable order."
 JAP_Gift_From_Kami: "A Gift from Kami?"
 JAP_Gift_From_Kami_desc: "Another issue has arisen. Prince Fumimaro Konoe has given his support to Sadao Araki, in order to counter our own influence. There are already heated discussions between members of the Toseiha faction, who see this as a direct threat to the already established order. We have to act subtly yet decisively, for one wrong step can potentially upset the Emperor himself and cause even greater trouble.. but at the same time, we must stop Araki.\n\nNo matter the danger and possible results, Japan has to be cleansed of its radical ways."
 JAP_One_Act_One_Profit: "One's Act, One's Profit"
 JAP_One_Act_One_Profit_desc: "The politics of the Empire is filled with intrigue and mystique, shadow puppet masters pull their string behind the scenes, and there's always powerplay scheme in motion. Like a ship, the Emperor is the commander, but he always takes his ‘advice’ from his devoted aides, some of which might influence him in a ‘bad’ way. Such people were the Kodoha faction, and their leader, Sadao Araki. And although this twisted man and his radical advice may have managed to nearly persuade the Emperor into thinking we have to be purged, in the end the reason and intellect of anti-radicalism have won.\n\nLike a ship, Japan has survived the domestic storm, and is ready to enter another, better prepared."

 JAP_The_Manchurian_Project_desc: "The Manchurian lands, while underdeveloped, present us with opportunity to expand our activities in northern Asia as a whole. The region possesses an abundance of natural resources that can fuel our growing armament industry. To make use of these, however, a large investment will be required. \n \nThe Manchurian Project is that investment. To turn these undeveloped lands into one of the backbones of the Imperial Japanese Army, expansive railway systems must be constructed in order to supply our troops in any war against China or the Soviet Union, while economic development in the form of factories and improved urban infrastructure will definitely present us in the brighter color to the local Manchu populace. \n\nManchuria is a goldmine - we just have to invest into it, and reap the profits."
 JAP_Carte_Blanche_to_the_Kwantung: "Carte Blanche to the Kanto-Gun"
 JAP_Carte_Blanche_to_the_Kwantung_desc: "The Kanto-Gun or the Kwantung Army has been the cornerstone of the Manchurian campaign, invading the lands with extreme efficiency. Born out of the Russo-Japanese war, the Kwantung Army has become increasingly autonomous and disobedient with the command in Tokyo. The Manchurian campaign was not something that we wanted, but the Army invaded anyway without our blessing, forcing us to accept their invasion for it will humiliate us if we do not. \n\nSeeing their interest in controlling this new territory, it could be wise to give them autonomy over controlling Manchurian affairs. After all, as long as they are at arm's length from the Home Islands, they surely won't stir up trouble. As long as they serve the empire well, there is no problem, right?"
 JAP_Blooming_Sakura: "The Blooming Sakura"
 JAP_Blooming_Sakura_desc: "The first step of the Manchurian Project should be making sure these lands get the full support of our government - as much as we can try, without proper investment the project is going to fail. \n\nWe will send proper industrial equipment, as well as required experts to Manchuria - and with the complexes they manage to build there, we will propel the Manchurian industry up, along with the production of steel, which we are going to require in the future. Not only this, making a proper production base will allow us to enlarge the Manchurian economy even more, giving us way more opportunities. \n\nLet the profits flow!"
 JAP_Birth_Kakushin_Kanryo: "The Birth of the Reform Bureaucrats"
 JAP_Birth_Kakushin_Kanryo_desc: "The kakushin kanryo, also known as the ‘reform bureaucrats’, will be a valuable asset in furthering our project of transforming Manchukuo into Japan’s production machine. \n\nEmployed directly by us and sent straight from Tokyo, these men will put constant pressure on the Manchurian economy, increasing production as well as making sure all the factories are pushed to their maximum output potential. In no time, our army is going to receive a great influx of industrial equipment, while our own economy will get even more resources!"
 JAP_Shadow_Behind_Throne: "The Shadow Behind the Throne"
 JAP_Shadow_Behind_Throne_desc: "Manchukuo, despite millions of yen pumped into its economy, has yet failed to understand how important the \"Pan-Asian\" between the two of us is, especially the local Manchu population, which has so far attempted to resist our peaceful means. Hard times require strong men, and in order to take care of the unruly population and bring peace to the countryside, a new person has to be chosen to keep things silent in Manchuria. \n\nNobusuke Kishi has shown great determination in his economic and political management of Manchukuo, and all of the cabinet believes that allowing him to take control will do wonders to the Manchurian Project. The option can be only one: send him in!"

 JAP_Bow_to_the_Daihonei: "Bow to the Daihon'ei"
 JAP_Bow_to_the_Daihonei_desc: "The influence and power of the Imperial General Headquarters, or Daihon'ei, is not to be underestimated. The Daihon'ei is responsible for coordinating joint efforts between the Imperial Army and Navy, a task that in itself is gargantuan in its undertaking, given the deeply-rooted interservice rivalry and hatred present in the IJA. Despite its militarist inclination and radical approach to government, the new Konoe cabinet must respect the Daihon'ei, who bow their heads to none but the Emperor himself."
 JAP_The_Special_Court_Marshal: "The Special Court Martial"
 JAP_The_Special_Court_Marshal_desc: "The February 26 Incident left deep scars within the various institutions of the Government. However, unlike earlier incidents of violence by officers of the Imperial Japanese Army, this incident will not go unpunished and justice shall be served. With Shirō Nonaka dead by suicide, the head of the snake has already been cut. Now that the Emperor has signed an ordinance establishing a Tokusetsu Gunpō Kaigi, or Special Court-Martial, all that remains is interrogating and identifying the main conspirators in the Kodoha faction and so-called Righteous Army."
 JAP_The_New_Order: "The Shintaisei"
 JAP_The_New_Order_desc: "In order to turn Japan into a true one-party state that channels the will of the Japanese populace, of the Emperor, and the Spirit of Yamato, the declaration of the Shintaisei, or New National Structure, will serve to fuse the elements of Showa Statism with our prime minister's more radical ideas. Together, these concepts, that range from Japan's birthright to empire to the role of the Japanese populace in fulfilling its holy mission, shall become the cornerstones in the foundation of the new Japanese state."
 JAP_The_Reform_Bureaucrats: "A Deal with the Reform Bureaucrats"
 JAP_The_Reform_Bureaucrats_desc: "The reform bureaucrats pursue a radical vision of Japan, where private and public spheres are one and the same and with an economic sphere dominated by technocrats. Their political sphere includes everything from state planners to total war theorists, making their experience and knowledge undisputed. With war on the horizon, total mobilization is a possibility, so the economy needs to be retooled.

The main purpose of the new movement is to inspire and move the citizens for total war, against any foe. The people of Japan might not fight a war for resources or land, but they will for their Emperor Shõwa. Propaganda ranging from posters, radio shows, and parades from the movement, will make sure our policies are cemented and taken well by our people.

Responsible for the rationing of goods, distribution of government bonds, and civil defence among themselves, these units of mobilisation will also be encouraged to spread propaganda, and organise participation in military parades. \n\nNeighbourhood associations could also prove to be useful for the maintenance of public security, as some within them could be used as informants for local police forces, allowing for citizens who commit infractions to be arrested, and those who have political and moral values that run counter to the interests of the national war effort to be silenced."

Centered around the Monarchy and Japanese militarism, our new party will not only increase the effectiveness of the New Order agenda, but eliminate the sectionalism that's been present in Japan for hundreds of years. This will allow us to finally see Japan as one culture and nation. Another, more subtle, goal of the Taisei Yokusankai is establishing Japan as a one party state, removing all other affiliations that are harmful to the Kokutai.

To counter this, our finance advisers have given us a draft of a law that could temporarily draw funds from different government funded programs to buy and build new factories to help this deficit. The new factories will help boost production in the area, manufacturing goods for the people, and parts for new factories being built. All we need is a little funding to make it happen."

But when we finally opened our eyes to the outside world, we found ourselves isolated. A country too primitive to understand western or European values, and used only for its trade. To the world, that's all we were good for. Then, the Meiji Restoration took hold. Sciences of all kinds flooded into our culture. Railroads, guns, mass production, steam power, and new ways of thinking suddenly came into reach of our \"primitive\" people. Now, due to the movement of the Shōwa Modan, we have as many patents of inventions equal to those of America and Germany. European powers constantly change their governments and ideals to fit the advance of technology. For us, we don't forget what brought us to this point. We adapt the new ways of thinking with the old.

Their overconfidence was met by the resolve and steel of an army reforged for the sole purpose of protecting the honour and glory of the emperor.\n\nSince then, not a moment has passed in which we did not seek to improve the already elite forces at our disposal. As his Excellency's vision for the Empire, necessitates the expansion of the Rising Sun in all corners where it's radiance can reach. After the last bout of modernization, our forces are more than ready to take on the world! Only the latest rifles, tanks and tactics are used by the Imperial Japanese Army. Settling for any less would endanger the future of this nation. \n\nWe have countless enemies, watching with greed as our prosperity soars and their suffering deepens. Let them try to snatch away what is rightfully ours. Their rabble is no match for us. We are the emperor’s loyal warriors, and we would rather die than allow anyone to trample his glory.\n\nTennōheika Banzai!"

Named the ‘Kantai Kessen’, meaning Decisive Battle Doctrine, this dictates that to win a war, the Japanese navy must win a single, decisive battle, in which the use of battleships is heavily needed.\n\nProof for the efficacy of this mindset can be seen in the Battle of Tsushima, where our smaller, but better-trained navy utterly destroyed the far larger fleet of the Russian Empire. A truly glorious moment for the Empire of Japan as a whole, its significance for the direction of the Imperial Japanese Navy is clear to this day.\n\nAs British naval dominance diminishes and the American navy becomes more and more of a threat, the Decisive Battle Doctrine shall prove to be as useful as 30 years ago. We will continue to use and improve this tested way of naval warfare. After all, there is no need to dispose of something which has yet to fail us, is there?"

The success of the mission aside, fascination with the idea of such a way of warfare led to the world's first purpose-built aircraft carrier by us, Hōshō, in 1922.\n\nOne school of thought that has been gaining more and more influence over the years is the ones supporting the building of the Imperial Japanese Navy around a group of aircraft carriers. These would allow us to target our enemies from a distance, preserving our already limited resources and negating the numerical superiority of forces such as the US Navy.\n\nWhile very costly to build and maintain, they could prove to be the deciding factor in a future conflict.

A mock engagement will take place between Honshu and the Tsugaro Strait. For this purpose, the First and Second Fleets will, as ‘Blue Fleet’, grapple against a temporarily organised ‘Fourth Fleet’ as Red Fleet.\n\nSuch a ‘battle’ will no doubt result in a great deal of experience for our proud Imperial Navy.

As our ambitions increase and become more apparent to our rivals, we find ourselves in greater need of ignoring the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty. The action itself is nothing extraordinary, for most other signatories have likewise ostensibly or secretly built ships that violate the tonnage and weaponry limits.\n\nIt is time for our fleet to take its rightful place as the leading naval power of the world.

Being well aware of this deficiency, we have always focused on outfitting them with the latest equipment, making sure that if not in quantity, we can match our enemies in quality.\n\nAnd until now, this strategy has worked. Time and time again our battleships have proven to be the crème de la crème, always besting our numerically superior enemies.\n\nHowever, times are changing. The mighty ship’s role is being questioned, with the aircraft carriers supposedly proving a better investment than the tried-and-true vessel.

Unhindered by such a blatant attempt at diminishing our might, the General Staff decided to somewhat ignore the limit and equipped them with an increased weapon load.\n\nAs the 1930s roll onwards, and new technologies are being implemented in the field of naval warfare, we have the perfect excuse to modernise our cruisers with the latest equipment. Light and heavy cruisers alike shall be retrofitted, and complemented, with the latest torpedo launchers and naval guns. And if they unintentionally reach 15.000 tonnes, then it can’t be helped."

A strategy of attacking the American fleets through ambush tactics is most optimal for our situation. To facilitate this plan of action, it would be in our best interest to develop torpedo cruisers. After all, even a single torpedo can sink even the mightiest of ships.\n\nAs our resources are limited we will have to improvise a little. Some of the older light cruisers, such as those of Kuma class, will be renovated and retrofitted with torpedo tubes.

In the beginning created only for temporary or special missions, the year 1932 would see them becoming an official unit called the Special Naval Landing Force.\n\nWhile not a true marine force, for its members are sailors with basic infantry training, they are nevertheless effective, as seen during the 28 January Incident. \n\nAnd we will need such special forces, now more than ever. Our greatest threat, the United States, maintains its grip on the Pacific through a series of islands that are scattered across the entire ocean.

As such, our great navy must be adequately prepared. Rather than renouncing or simply cheating the treaty, we will abide by it. We shall take an unconventional way to naval superiority instead. Our shipyards will produce smaller, more agile vessels rather than giant battleships, as even the smallest ship with enough finesse can take down the biggest boat.

To achieve the before-mentioned speeds, it shall have four Kampon steam turbines, which will be powered by eight water boilers. These turbines shall produce a total of 160,000 horsepower. To be able to adequately defend itself, the vessels will use eight Type 89 anti-aircraft guns. If these weapons are unable to deter the enemy, the 46 mm thick copper-alloy armour will surely shield it from any oncoming attacks. With such properties, the Twin Cranes shall rightfully be the jewel of the Imperial Japanese Navy."

Submarines shall also be a significant part of our naval arsenal, as they can easily deliver devastating blows to enemy convoys using their powerful torpedos. If our opponents try to shoot back, our valiant subs will submerge and disappear from their sight. Finally, one of our most important tactics in naval supremacy shall be the usage of nautical mines, as they can be hidden underwater and deal substantial damage to an unexpecting enemy. All of these unconventional weapons shall give our Imperial Navy a clever edge above the other great powers."

Another special type of submarine shall be the midget sub. They can be excellent for harbor penetration, because of their size and ability to stay underwater.

This will of course also have the obvious benefit of supplying our military with a constant stream of quality equipment. After placing our orders for new tanks, airplanes, and guns, we will soon see a massive boost in the Japanese economy and attain the support of those who have had doubts.

It seems to lack the necessary authority among low-level government bureaucrats, and has yet to have had the profound effect we initially expected it to. Whilst production of munitions and other such dealings have seen a moderate increase, it is nowhere near what we can do, and nowhere near what we need. In order to hastily rectify this situation, the newly-proposed Munitions Company Act shall impose a series of measures to increase armaments production by cutting through the red tape on the home front and punish severely any official who finds themselves ignoring their orders. This swift action will grant the new ministry the authority it so desperately needs, and ensure the armament industry's full commitment to the war effort."

While we won the rest of the seats, the problem lies in the remaining ones, which are occupied by those critical of Prime Minister Hideki Tojo. From liberals to fascists, these troublesome individuals could seriously hinder the war effort by their presence alone.\n\nWe cannot allow disunity during such a critical time. To resolve this conundrum, we shall form a caucus. The Yokusan Seijikai, meaning the ‘Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association’, will represent our interests directly in the parliament.

Rumors circulate about backdoor discussions, temporary alliances, and the like, all with the aim of deposing this loyal man.\n\nHave they forgotten who gave Tojo the duty of leading this glorious nation in these times of turmoil? It was His Majesty himself who appointed him as Prime Minister. His capacity to further the interests of the Rising Sun makes him trustworthy for the position. To deny his will is to disobey the emperor, the highest treason imaginable.\n\nIf they wish to oppose the most loyal of servants, then so be it. Their games and plots will be rendered insignificant by the emperor’s word. Hideki Tojo shall, as he has always done, seek an audience with His Majesty, where he will ask for his support. With an almost predictable outcome, this endeavor will cement the Prime Minister’s authority."

In his place, Kuniaki Koiso, Governor-General of Korea, has been chosen. Favored by the Imperial Army but opposed by the civilian government, no one actually expects him to do anything significant in his new position, being seen as more of a compromise until the political landscape stabilizes."

Having the two most powerful men in the Empire, not including the emperor, stand shoulder to shoulder will guarantee the unity of the Imperial apparatus.

 JAP_The_Fading_Ballot_Box_desc: "Ever since the passage of the Peace Preservation Law of 1925, our grandiose experiment for Eastern Democracy is a mere distant memory, one too old for the people of Nippon to remember. The subversion of the democratic process is seen in all facets of Nippon - from the apathetic populace who are disgusted by the pervasive corruption and politicking, to the military technocrats who strongarm the Diet and other legislative bodies for the sake of preserving the Kokutai (National Polity).\n\nThese factors, along with weakening civilian institutions, has led to the civilian government being increasingly subservient to the whims of the military, along with being unable to control army groups such as the Kwantung Army, whose incursions into Manchuria is a sentiment not shared by Tokyo. As such, the future of the civilian government has been subjected to much speculation, though all signs seem to point unfavorably..."

 JAP_The_Military_Ascendant: "The Military Ascendant"
 JAP_The_Military_Ascendant_desc: "Ever since the days of the Meiji era, the military forces of Nippon have been given a special place in our society. Seen as protectors of the people who serve the emperor, the military has been the focal point in our victories in Korea and in Russia, defeating our adversaries in a whim. As such, they are often paraded as heroes and saviours to the people, and are often given a respectable amount of prestige that no single individual could ever imagine.\n\nHowever, what was once the protectors of the state, have concluded, to become the state.\n\nEver since the success of the Mukden Incident, the military has taken a rather extreme approach in dealing with politics. Gone are the days when the Civilian government is unilaterally superior than the military establishment. Now, the military dictates the policy directions of Tokyo, either by forcing utmost neutrality in the Cabinet, to even assassinating Prime Ministers if they are seen as a threat to their growing power. Japan's destiny squarely lies on a blade's edge."

While yes, that is true, that doesn't tell the full story.\n\nThe empire's armed forces are very much divided, with the Army and the Navy constantly in discord against one another in an effort to assert dominance over government affairs. From different foreign policy doctrines, to even the Army containing naval assets and the Navy containing land-based assets, their rivalry is unprecedented, far more than any nation on the planet.\n\nCurrently, the IJA and the IJN have a rather §gNeutral§! stance.
