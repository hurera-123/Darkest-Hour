 GER_SOV_War.0.t: "Barbarossa Thwarted, New Directives are Required."
 GER_SOV_War.0.d: "The initial stages of Unternehmen Barbarossa resulted in significant advances in Russia, while initially impressive, the advances by the Heer have stalled. And with the frigid winter setting in, the Grenadiers and Panzers have had no choice but to dig in. \n\nThe initially stated objectives have not been met successfully, large bodies of Russian troops have been able to escape encirclement. Along with this, major population and industrial centres are still in enemy hands, and we are still a long way in securing the “A-A Line”.\n\nThis makes the resumption of our advances in the East of almost urgency, for the Bolsheviks cannot be allowed respite to regroup. And accordingly, the OKH has decided to continues our operations as soon as the Summer comes. \n\nBut herein lies our predicament, the frontline units are depleted, supplies are running low, partisans run rampant behind the lines, winter clothing and shelter are lacking, troops stuff their stolen Red Army coats with newspapers to attempt to fight off the cold, but we still endure. After assessing our general situation, simply put- it is logistically and physically impossible to resume the operations on a broad front.\n\nWe can only concentrate our forces in a single particular sector and hope we achieve an overwhelming victory there. And attempt to precipitate a large enough crisis in the Soviet lines, which allows us to eventually fold it and push the Reds out of European Russia. We can either launch an offensive in the North to isolate Russia from foreign aid or smash their lines in the Centre and bifurcate their lines or if we want- we can strike into the Caucasus and pluck the rich pickings of the oil fields in Maikop, Grozny, Baku, etc."

 GER_SOV_War.2.d: "After years of preparation, finally, our time has come. Like the Teutonic Order, like the Prussian Kingdom, finally, we will launch all our forces into a new, modern crusade for the liberation of all the Germanic people!\n\nAlong the entire border we share with the Soviets, our troops have started to advance into the despicable communist nation. Ready to take Moscow, Leningrad, Stalingrad, our brave and powerful soldiers will not stop until the complete surrender of the Bolsheviks!\n\nJust like twenty years earlier, the Brest-Litovsk treaty will be enforced by our army! Our main objectives are to liberate Ostland, Ukraine, the Caucasus and Moscow. We will also establish Reichskommissariats here, to ensure the beginning of German colonisation of Russia. After the end of the war, the resources of the Reich will be infinite."
 GER_SOV_War.2.A: "How many crusades are there now? Nine? Yeah, this will be the Ninth Crusade!"

 GER_SOV_War.7.t: "Red Star Rising"
 GER_SOV_War.7.d: "It seems almost an era ago, when the Fascist Scum betrayed all our standing agreements and "friendship" treaties, and began massive incursions all along our border. Within days, the catastrophe was evident, these “incursions” were the spearheads of massive pincers, that encircled large parts of the Red Army. The Luftwaffe grounded the VVS and the Red Navy was bottled up in the major ports.\n\nWe gave ground, but the nation held on, within months the Soviet society was mobilised for war in the most absolute terms. Massive conscription, Tractor factories being retooled to churn out Armoured Legions, Party bosses mobilising cadres to facilitate the war effort, and the likes were commonplace.\n\nDespite this, there were unmitigated disasters in the early days. But for every Division we lost, we learnt, the STAVKA learnt, the Front Commander learnt, the Army Commander learnt, and the Rifleman who escaped..........he also learnt. And most surprisingly, even the dogs learnt, strapped with explosives they did their fare share to teach the fascist scum. The German officers are ageing men, with experience and all no doubt, but the new breed that is emerging from within the rank and file of Red Army is that of young, dynamic and decisive leaders, destined to turn the tide.\n\nAfter such a heavy cost in manpower, land and material we have accumulated unparalleled experience, new raisings receive experience in "quiet sectors" and are blooded and experience to be committed in offensives. Slowly but surely, we have come a long way, our Army is finally standing ground, even pushing the fascists back in some places. Massive Industrial complexes in the Urals churn out endless lines of tanks, planes and guns, their bright furnaces working all day with no rest. It's time to finally take back the fight to the enemy. For it might be a long way to Berlin for us, but even longer for the Fascists to ever reach the Urals."

 GER_SOV_War.10.t: "Your Mother's Prayer"
 GER_SOV_War.10.d: "\"The Germans are not humans.\", Nikolai mutters to himself, thinking about the latest letter he had received from his mother, containing a poem he had read so many times, that it had burned into his memories.\n\n\"We shall not get excited. We shall kill.\", he whispers, as he stands amidst the ruins of a bombed school, taking cover behind a collapsed pillar. Not long ago, in a different life, he was in a similar school like this. Back then he hated it, but now he wishes nothing more than to be back.\n\n\"If you have not killed at least one German a day, you have wasted that day.\", he says, bullets whizzing over his head, contemplating his next actions. The Germans had him pinned down from across the street. Looking around, he realizes he is alone. The rest of his unit is either nowhere to be seen or laying dead on the street. If he hadn't sought cover in the school, he would have shared their fate.\n\n\"Kill the German - this is the cry of your Russian earth.\", he finishes reciting the poem, as the gunfire stopped. As he gets up from behind the pillar, prepared to kill whoever was pinning him down, he sees a boy. A young German boy, no older than 16, maybe the same age as him, struggling to reload his gun. For a second Nikolai froze. The boy was probably forced to be here, just like himself. Then the end of the poem shot into his mind: "Do not waver. Do not let up.""
 GER_SOV_War.10.A: "\"Kill.\""

 GER_SOV_War.11.t: "Every Hand Helps"
 GER_SOV_War.11.d: "Yuiry, a young boy, was awakened earlier than usual today by his mother because it was time to dig trenches. He quickly put on his oversized boots, which his older brother Nikolai had left for him after being sent to the frontlines at the start of the war. Like his brother, Yuiry will go to any length to protect his town and the motherland.\n\nYuiry and his mother were exhausted after working long hours digging and moving planks with the locals. They decided to take a break and rest for a while. During their break, a Kazakh unit arrived in town and was greeted with gifts of food and medical supplies. Yuiry, eager to show his appreciation, quickly ran to his house to grab a fresh loaf of bread. He then approached one of the soldiers, offering him the bread as a gesture of thanks. The soldier, who reminded him a lot of Nikolai, gratefully accepted the bread. And, like Nikolai, the soldier was known for his sense of humour and calm demeanour, even in difficult situations.\n\nSuddenly, the air raid sirens began to wail loudly, and parents and their children hid from the German planes, while Yuiry and his mother ran to their house for safety. Yuiry watched as the soldier took up arms with his comrades and took up positions in the trenches."

 GER_SOV_War.14.t: "Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact Signed"
 GER_SOV_War.14.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Today, Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka and Ambassador Yoshitsugu Tatekawa met in Moscow with Vyacheslav Molotov. A potential neutrality agreement between the Soviet Union and Japan was the reason for the meeting.\n\nThe Soviet Union sought this deal to secure their border with the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo in the Far East and to narrow their attention to the German Reich's frontier in Europe in case a conflict broke out in the future. The Japanese were keen to sign this deal because they wanted to concentrate on their military campaign against the Chinese United Front and their expansion into South-East Asia.\n\nInternational observers have called this a “surprising turn of events”, considering that these countries recently engaged in border wars in Mongolia with each other. "
 GER_SOV_War.14.A: "Our eastern flank, secured at last."
 GER_SOV_War.14.B: "We can now focus on our main target..."
 GER_SOV_War.14.C: "An uneasy deal between uneasy nations."

 GER_SOV_War.15.t: "Japan Refuses the Pact"
 GER_SOV_War.15.d: "\"Sir, the Japanese have refused to sign a treaty of non-aggression.\"\n\n[SOV.GetLeader]'s hand tightened. Under the strain, the pencil he was holding cracked. As he gazed at the map of [SOV.GetNameDef] before him, one thought dominated his mind: "What now?"\n\nBut he knew the answer was straightforward. In the event of war, he'd have to maintain a defensive posture in both the Asian and European theatres. To repel invasion from both directions, he'd have to divide his resources east and west. He'd have to keep looking over his shoulder as he prepared to fight on one side to make sure the other didn't pounce on him.\n\n"I should've known this was going to happen," [SOV.GetLeader] thought to himself. The Japanese government had made no secret of their dislike for [SOV.GetNameDef]. The Japanese had many issues with the Soviets, ranging from recent border clashes in Manchuria to ownership of the Sakhalin Islands. Not to mention that the Russians' disastrous defeat at the hands of the Japanese some 30 years before had not been forgotten by the Russian people.\n\nHe'd assumed there were bigger fish to fry. He assumed Japan was more concerned with China. More interested in Southeast Asia's resource-rich regions. After all, the value of the Siberian tundra pales in comparison to the East Indies' rich oil deposits.\n\nHowever, it was now clear that he was completely incorrect. The Japanese tiger in Manchuria was tightening its claws, preparing to pounce on Siberia and Mongolia. He could see his country's armed forces and resources being depleted by the enormous demand of war on two fronts. He could now see his country being shattered by the Germans and the Japanese...."
 GER_SOV_War.15.A: "We must ensure that they will have nothing but dust and blood."

 GER_SOV_War.101.t: "Our Focus Shifts to the Offensive"
 GER_SOV_War.101.d: "For years now, Stalin has maintained the Union outside of conflicts. If he wants to believe in the Global Revolution, he knows this objective is impossible to accomplish if we look into our current means.\n\nBut, as the shadow of the war kept coming closer to our borders, the Soviet leadership, composed of most of the leaders from the Party, as well as the great names of the Red Army, has taken the decision to now concentrate all our budget into the offensive.\n\nAs this committee argues, we can’t wait to be in a total war against foreign aggressors to prepare ourselves. We need to prepare for the invasion and liberation of border countries. We need to destroy the fascist-capitalist menace once and for all. And to do this, we must plunge a sword into their hearts… before they do it to us."
 GER_SOV_War.101.A: "Comrades, the future of the Soviet Union is not in Europe, nor is he in Asia. Our future is in Eurasia!"
