 USA_Landon.1.t: "Protests from the Teachers' Union"
 USA_Landon.1.d: "The day's newspaper tucked under her arm, Mary pushed through the back door, and into the White House mailroom. A mountain of letters greeted her.\n\n”The education cuts, I take it?”\n\nThey came in early this morning, her boss told her- mail from what must have been every little red schoolhouse in the country, all addressed to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. With a quiet sigh of determination, the young woman scooped up two dozen letters and carried them to her desk. It'll be another late night, she thought.\n\nSliding her trusty letter opener across the front of an envelope, Mary extracted its contents with a practised flourish.\n\n”Mr President, The budget cuts you've proposed are nothing short of shameful. I've taught here in Boulder for almost 15 years now, even spending some of my pay, as little as it is, to buy chalk. Never have I been asked to do so much with so little. The roof leaks in the winter. I've taken to using old apple crates to replace broken chairs. These children deserve an education, even if that only means being able to write their own name. Things are bad enough as they are; some of the other teachers from the union are talking about a strike-”\n\nThe letter went on until the end of the page, where it concluded with a single name; Louise Harris.\n\nGently biting her lip, the clerk began to pen a response."
 USA_Landon.1.A: "Dear Ms. Harris..."

 USA_Landon.2.t: "Tax Break Payoff"
 USA_Landon.2.d: "With the recent passing of new tax break legislation, thousands of businesses across the nation are set to benefit from being able to keep a larger portion of their earnings instead of needing to give it to the government. We hope that this will allow for better growth across the country, as well as encouraging new investors and startups to help dig our way out of the Great Depression.\n\nWhile it is important that legislation works, some within our nation are skeptical. The Democrats, for example, are concerned that this could hamper our chances at a quick and smooth recovery, arguing that the New Deal was a better plan for long term growth. Others are also questioning whether this will help out millions of working-class citizens across the USA, but only time will answer that."
 USA_Landon.2.A: "Read my lips: no new taxes!"

 USA_Landon.3.t: "Rebalancing New Deal Budget"
 USA_Landon.3.d: "”Alright, Frank, where are we at?”\n\n”I asked my staff to create some folders regarding the cost of the New Deal, its general budget, and future projections concerning national debt. I have to warn you, Mr.President, this entire report is 80 pages long, so I fear we don't have to go over every detail in this meeting. I suggest that we schedule another meeting for Thursday or Friday if you please,”\n\n”No, I need to grab this problem by the horns. The other Republicans are already breathing down my neck to throw out the New Deal in this instant. What is the summary of your report?”\n\n”Ok, I will keep it brief: The biggest factor in the entire New Deal budget and thus the largest part of our expenses is the welfare and pensions spending. Some of the conservative Republicans even accuse us of aggressively throwing money at the people to get them to go bother someone else,”\n\n”On the other hand, education spending is also tearing a big hole into the budget. The report also suggests that a lot of money is wasted on the New Deal's bureaucracy. You throw it in at the top, and it disappears towards the bottom,”\n\n”How popular are these points with the public?”\n\n”They are very popular. I think you know why,”\n\n”Dammit, we'll have to cut at least something, otherwise, we might as well declare bankruptcy now. Lemme see...”"
 USA_Landon.3.A: "We have to cut welfare and pensions. It is simply too much money."
 USA_Landon.3.B: "Reduce the education budget, most of the money doesn't go to where it is supposed to go anyways."

 USA_Landon.4.t: "Business Support Act"
 USA_Landon.4.d: "FROM: OFFICE OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE IN DES MOINES, IOWA\nTO: MR JOSEPH SMITH, SMITHS GOODS LTD, DES MOINES; IOWA\nSUBJECT: TAX REBATE FOR [This.GetYear]\n\nDear Mr. Smith,\n\nWe want to inform you that due to a calculation error, namely the filing of\nyour taxes according to the standards set before the adoption of the Business Support Act.\nAfter adjustments for the new current tax rates, we show an over-taxation of $368.23.\n\nWe will mail a check for said amount to you before year's end and would\nstrongly advise you to review the contents of the Business Support Act\nto avoid mistakes like this in the future.\n\nFurthermore, if you have any more questions or complaints you can\nvisit us at our office at 210 Walnut Street, Des Moines, Iowa.\nWith best regards, "
 USA_Landon.4.A: "Franklin Harburg - Department Lead"

 USA_Landon.5.t: "Congress Debates New Tax Law"
 USA_Landon.5.d: "Today another part of President Landon's agenda will finally be debated and voted upon in Congress: Tax Breaks. With the New Deal, came a significant increase in taxes, especially for larger businesses. These tax increases have been widely criticized by the Republican Party, calling it an ”unfair burden” and ”damaging for the economy”. Meanwhile, the Democratic Party insists that the existing taxes are necessary to maintain an acceptable standard of living for Americans, arguing that it is only fair that large businesses are taxed accordingly to their success. \n\nAs a Republican, President Landon himself favors generous tax breaks, but to advance his agenda beyond that, he needs to maintain at least some goodwill within the Democratic Party. Some people have already called for less generous tax breaks as a compromise. However, this has been criticized by members of both parties. \n\nIn the end, after many hours of debate and argumentation, Congress has come to a decision, which will soon affect every American."
 USA_Landon.5.A: "Generous Tax Breaks Will Ensure a Strong Economy!"
 USA_Landon.5.B: "We Need to Calm the Democrats A Bit - Compromise!"

 USA_Landon.6.t: "Return to Fiscal Conservatism"
 USA_Landon.6.d: "Today President Alf Landon has officially announced to Congress that his administration will seek to discontinue the policies of the New Deal to return to fiscal conservatism. While Landon has run for the White House opposing the New Deal, it still has come as a shock to many that the President who campaigned on a compromise has decided to enact this radical step to roll back the New Deal.\n\nLandon's plans are still not finalized, but it is expected that the main points will be a further decrease in Taxes, the Privatization of Agencies founded during the New Deal as well as some Protectionist Tariffs on foreign goods.\n\nEven though the Republican party is pleased with its success in Congress, there have been harsh criticisms from enthusiastic supporters of the New Deal, from the Democratic Party to the lower strata of society. Landon has nonetheless promised that his reforms will lead to widespread wealth and prosperity for all Americans."
 USA_Landon.6.A: "A Compromise Option no More."

 USA_Landon.7.t: "Dire Straits of Civic Federation"
 USA_Landon.7.d: "The National Civic Federation was originally in 1900 to serve as an economic organization that sought to bring together chosen representatives from big business, organized labor, and consumer advocates to mediate disputes arising between industry and organized labor.\nHowever, the National Civic Federation has long been on the decline, with workers criticizing the Federation as ” a puppet tool of big business” while the employers have reduced their financial backing and support due to the Federations support for Unions and collective bargaining, seen as ”watered down communism”, leaving the Federation in dire straits.\n\nNonetheless, President Landon has recognized the need for an organization capable of mediating class disputes and has chosen the National Civic Federation as the only organization capable of this job. Additional funding by the state and a public campaign aimed at increasing membership numbers and participation in the organization will pave the way for an empowered mediation platform where both the workers and their employers can work out their differences in a constructive,non-destructive way."
 USA_Landon.7.A: "There Is No Place for Class Struggle in Our America"

 USA_Landon.8.t: "Congress Debates Child Labor"
 USA_Landon.8.d: "Now that President Landon has chosen the way the American economy will take for the future the Congress has decided to debate the highly controversial topic of child labor.\n\nChild labor has never been a stranger to American society with many children starting to work in Factories at a young age, to support their families, often doing dangerous work for low wages.\n\nWhile the amount of child labor has steadily decreased over the years, only faring up again during the Great Depression the Democratic Party has nonetheless spent considerable amounts of time campaigning for the complete outlawing of Child labor, with the Republican Party arguing that any illegalization would lead to undeclared work, the destruction of the livelihoods for many families and a significant loss of personnel in the factories.\n\nThis topic is an extremely sensitive one, with almost all outcomes set to anger a good amount of the American people, where the Workers and Upper Class fear for a loss of money and workers, while the Middle Class is positioned firmly against any sort of ”barbaric” child labor.\n\nIn Congress, the debate will also be a heated one with politicians of both sides doing their best to swing to either side.\n\nNevertheless, the votes have been counted with the result being..."
 USA_Landon.8.A: "...the Complete Outlawing of Child Labor in the United States!"

 USA_Landon.9.t: "Lane and Landon Meet"
 USA_Landon.9.d: "”Ah Mr. Lane, a pleasure! Please have seat. Would you care for a drink?” The President presented the Republican with his best smile, practised to perfection by years of campaigning and politics.\n”A coffee if you don´t mind, the journey has been quite tedious. With only a splash of milk.”\nLane returned his fake smile, convincing the average person but as a President, one tends to learn quickly which smile is sincere and which isn´t. ”Of course. Nancy, could you please bring Mr.Lane his coffee? Thank you.”\nAs the Secretary quickly exited the room, the President once again faced the rebellious Republican.\n”I´m quite sure, you already know why I brought you here.”\n”Yes.”\n”And you know what I want you to do.”\n”Yes. But I am afraid that you have met a brick wall, Mr. President. What you want me to do is nothing short of a complete and utter betrayal of my principles. I will never back your ludicrous agenda.”\n”I see. Why?”\n”Why? Because you will ruin the lives of millions of people throughout this entire country you goddamm-... Ahem...excuse me. I am in quite an irritable mood today. Nonetheless, the people will not stand for this and I won´t either. Hardline Fiscal Conservatism will doom this country and this Party even more.”\nThe President let out a deep sigh and started massaging his temples.\n”Dammit Lane, it´s not like I am about to hand over the entire country to Henry Ford. You will see that the people will profit from this. We will get a real economy flowing again! Money, jobs, trade! Everything! We just need to get the business rolling again!”\n”By kicking the poor in the gutter? For a bit of money and power? You hero.”\n”Lane, we simply need to show unity for this one vote. I´ll make it up to you I promise. You will need money for your campaigns, you will get money. You will get a position in the government. Everything. I just need one vote.”\n”My soul for the world. Let me think about it. But rest assured that I won´t forget your offer.”"
 USA_Landon.9.A: "“I am sure you won´t”"

 USA_Landon.10.t: "Meeting with Garner and Rayburn"
 USA_Landon.10.d: "President Landon has big plans for this country, but with some Republican senators blocking our agenda, it is necessary to look over the Trenches and try to get at least some Democrats on our side. To convince the Democrats, President Landon has decided to call John Nance Garner and Sam Rayburn, both opponents of the New Deal and the unofficial leaders of the Anti-New Deal Democrats.\n\nIn this meeting, the President hopes to persuade both Garner and Rayburn to win them and their cliques' support by both appealing to their personal beliefs and making concessions to the Democrats further down the line. This move to blatantly decide behind our Parties back will certainly cause some animosity with the Republicans and their voters, but we shall do whatever we can to get the ball rolling again."
 USA_Landon.10.A: "Policy over Party."

 ### Revisiting Smoot-Hawley
 USA_Smoot_Hawley.1.t: "Revisiting Smoot-Hawley"
 USA_Smoot_Hawley.1.d: "Formally called the United States Tariff Act of 1930, the law has eventually taken the name of its sponsors, Senator Reed Owen Smoot and Representative Willis Chatman Hawley. Enacted in June 1930, the law raised the already high import tariffs on foreign industrial and agricultural products with the purpose of protecting American farmers and industries from international competition. Despite President Hoover’s reluctance and over 1.000 economists urging him to veto it, the protectionist Act passed amidst the fear caused by the Great Depression.\n\nThe consequences were felt almost immediately. Trading partners of the USA, already gravely affected by the effects of the economic crisis and the reconstruction costs following the Great War, had their economies further damaged by the Act. In a retaliatory move, 25 countries increased their own tariffs. International commerce declined by over two-thirds between 1929 and 1934, in no small part due to the protectionist laws implemented as a consequence of the Smoot-Hawley Act. The US economy suffered drastically, consequently plunging the country even deeper into the economic crisis.\n\nDemocrat President Franklin Delano Roosevelt wasted no time in reversing the law’s effects, passing the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act in 1934, which allows the White House to directly negotiate tariff policy with other heads of state.\n\nWith the coming of Alf Landon at the White House, however, a return to the old policy is to be undertaken. Arguing that the negative effects of the tariffs came as a result of the Great Depression only, the President has once more put forward the Tariff Act, stating that the economical resurgence and stabilization of the last years will assure that Smoot-Hawley will have its intended effects, protecting the US economy whilst propelling it ever upward."
 USA_Smoot_Hawley.1.A: "We Must Protect American Companies."

 USA_Smoot_Hawley.2.t: "Henry Ford Speaks Out Against the Bill!"
 USA_Smoot_Hawley.2.d: "American industrialist, business magnate, and founder of the Ford Motor Company and chief developer of the assembly line technique of mass production, Henry Ford is a known opponent of the Smoot-Hawley Act, famously going to the White House to convince former President Herbert Hoover to veto it, calling it an ‘economic stupidity’\n\nAs US economical prosperity seems to once again be at risk, the business magnate has restarted his rhetoric, stating that the Republicans forgot it was them who plunged the country even deeper into the Depression with their protectionist policies, and the Act would serve to only do it once more. Using his influence among industrialists and politicians alike, Ford hopes to mount a sizable enough opposition to force either the President or the Senate to drop their ‘childish dreams’, for ‘only children think they can get what they want by not giving to others.’"
 USA_Smoot_Hawley.2.A: "What Does He Know?"

 USA_Smoot_Hawley.3.t: "House Liberals Oppose the Bill!"
 USA_Smoot_Hawley.3.d: "In an unsurprising move, the Progressives, Democrats, and even some Republicans from the House of Representatives have released a joint declaration, in which they decry the Tariff Act as foolish and counter-intuitive to national interests. It appears that former President Roosevelt’s shadow still looms over the political landscape, the supposed success of his economic policies turning many to his free-trade rhetoric. \n\nIt is too late to have any of them change their mind. All that we can do is make sure the ones who still have our backs remain steadfast in their decision to have the Bill pass."
 USA_Smoot_Hawley.3.A: "We Must Push This Through, With or Without Their Support."

 USA_Smoot_Hawley.4.t: "The Bill Moves to the Senate"
 USA_Smoot_Hawley.4.d: "The day has finally come. With a narrow success in the House of Representatives, the Smoot-Hawley Act will now have to pass through the Senate, a far more hostile environment to our interests. The Democrats and Progressives will do anything in their power to make sure the Bill remains only in the documents of the National Archives, and shall never again ‘hurt the Land of the Free’. \n\nDebates, shouting matches, and ‘donations’ are but a few tactics employed by them and us to make sure the Act either fails or succeeds. Whoever succeeds will set the tone for the remaining Presidential term, with an opposition victory assuring an unstable political landscape for the remainder of Alf Landon’s term. \n\nAll that can be done now is to wait."
 USA_Smoot_Hawley.4.A: "Let's Hope All Goes Well..."

 USA_Smoot_Hawley.5.t: "The Bill has Passed!"
 USA_Smoot_Hawley.5.d: "Excellent news! After a fierce confrontation between us and the Democratic-Progressive opposition to pass the Smoot-Hawley Act one more time, we have won! It was a narrow win, as it was back in the summer of 1930, with 44 to 42 votes for, but our citizens can rest assured, for their voice has been heard.\n\nWe have no time to waste. We must implement the new tariffs. Foreign agricultural and industrial products will have their tariffs raised again, to the anger and detriment of the international community, no doubt. But our duty lies with the American people first and foremost. Surely they would do the same if they were in our position."
 USA_Smoot_Hawley.5.A: "Huzzah!"

 USA_Smoot_Hawley.6.t: "The United States has Imposed Tariffs on Us!"
 USA_Smoot_Hawley.6.d: "It seems the Americans have decided to not learn from the past, and have followed their isolationist policy even in the economic field. With the recent presidential victory of Alf Landon, the Republican has decided to revisit the Smoot-Hawley Act, a 1930 law that raised import tariffs on foreign agricultural and industrial products. Happening during the Great Depression, the effects of the Act certainly did not help any economy, not even the US one. With a trade downturn of over two-thirds, the tariffs only helped to further strain the economies of the world.\n\nBack then, we, along with many other countries, retaliated against this protectionist policy by raising our own tariffs on American goods. This helped somewhat, but the scrapping of the law by former Democrat President Franklin Delano Roosevelt led to a return of mutually beneficial trade and helped the recovery of international commerce.\n\nWith the return of the Smoot-Hawley Act, we find ourselves once again negatively affected by American economic theory backwardness. We can answer in kind, of course. Tariffs can once more be put on US goods. While this is a situation from which no one would benefit, we can at least mitigate the effects of the law, and hope that perhaps they will see reason, as they once did.\n\nAnother option is to simply accept reality and adapt accordingly. The US is an important trading partner, and further limiting commerce between us would lead to a worsening of relations. Having to deal with increased tariffs is certainly damaging to our economy, but decreasing our access to their markets, and theirs to our own, is a less desirable outcome."
 USA_Smoot_Hawley.6.A: "We Have More Important Issues to Deal With."
 USA_Smoot_Hawley.6.B: "We Must Protect Our Companies, Too."

 USA_Smoot_Hawley.6.t: "[Root.GetName] Retaliates!"
 USA_Smoot_Hawley.6.d: "As a consequence expected by all but a few, (Country name) have decided to retaliate by raising their own tariffs on our goods. This wouldn’t be the first time they did that, as the first passing of the Smoot-Hawley Act led to the same outcome during the Great Depression. \n\nThis time, however, it will be different. No longer as weak as during that dark period, our economy is far more resilient and capable of adapting to the volatility of international commerce. We are capable of resisting such blows to our trade, or so we hope. [Root.GetName] might eventually decide their tantrum may not be worth it and accept the price of trading with the Land of the Free. Of course, they can also continue on their course, and suffer the consequences. It matters little to us, for we have accomplished what we set out to do: protect American business and products."
 USA_Smoot_Hawley.6.A: "This Seems Familiar Somehow..."

 US_special.1.d: "The leadership of Italy assured America that they were desirous of peace, but the Government of Italy has now chosen to preserve what it terms its 'Freedom of Action' and the hand that held the dagger has struck it into the back of its neighbor. Some indeed still hold to the now obvious delusion that we of the United States can safely permit the United States to remain a lone island in a world dominated by force. We might once more have to intervene in a European war."

 USA.3.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]\nJust a few days ago an onslaught of tornadoes hit hard in the Deep South, reaching even into some parts of Mississippi. Accounts of the event tell us of about 10 to 12 tornadoes which touched down. Most affected were the towns of Gainesville, Georgia and Tupelo, Mississippi. While the inhabitants have just crawled out of the shelters and some lucky survivors escaped their destroyed homes, the question now lies on how both the local governments and the federal government will respond.

 USA.4.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]\nFollowing the United States Steel Corporation signing a union contract, many other smaller steel companies have refused to join, leading to the Steel Workers Organizing Committee to call a strike in protest. On Memorial Day, tensions rose to a boiling point as hundreds of protestors gathered at the SWOC headquarters and began a march towards the Republic Steel mill, their path blocked by the Chicago Police, leading to a heated confrontation. Feeling threatened the police officers opened fire on the crowd, and in the resulting chaos, at least thirty protestors were hit by police bullets, killing ten, while some hundred others were beaten with clubs, at least thirty-seven suffering serious head injuries."

Premiering at the Carthay Circle Theatre in Hollywood and set to show nationwide in the following months, Walt Disney's film, based on the classic fairytale, has been met with critical praise and sets a new precedent for the future of animation in the cinema. It is predicted to be a top earner at the box office following its initial premiere."

 USA.6.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]\nIn the span of just a few days, two separate Pacific storms nearly washed California away as they deposited over a year's worth of rain in less than a single week. Three major rivers, the Los Angeles, the San Gabriel and the Santa Ana, burst their banks and caused much flooding to the coastal plains and surrounding valleys, inflicting over $78 million in damages, and taking over one hundred lives in the devastation. \n\nIn order to prevent future events like this from occurring, the Army Corps of Engineers and other agencies have proposed a new system of channels, control dams and basins to contain and prevent any future floodwater."

We must set up AA towers, fortify the beaches and prepare for the worst. The Japanese, these criminals, will be stopped, democracy will prevail and these monsters will be dealt with.

 USA.9.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]\nFollowing years of liberal legislation, the New Deal has turned its proverbial eyes to the question of trade unions. Legalized in Britain over half a century ago, unions set to equalize the playing field of labor and management, negating the imbalance of bargaining power by adhering to the collective. If a single man cannot stand his ground against the greed of management, he might find solace in his fellow workers striving towards the same goals: fair pay, fair hours, fair benefits.\nOn this day, amidst another push of the New Deal, Franklin D. Roosevelt has signed the National Labor Relations Act into law, enforcing the will of the worker whilst maintaining the market economy America was built upon. Critics may say this is a step towards the ways of communism, but dissidents of the New Deal may be ignored with all good faith. This bill of law marks one step closer to our goal."

 USA.10.d: "“Next!”\n\nFor three months now, the war has raged on in Spain. The government, in its policy of neutrality, knows one thing: war will come to America one day. So, in preparation of any coming conflict, new recruits have been raised across the nation. But what no one had envisaged was the idea that war can attract even personalities, and today, a pioneer of aviation, Amelia Earhart herself, is in a recruiting office!\n\nHaving someone so famous in our ranks can have many advantages: Amelia knows how to fly; she has a good knowledge of the world, like the Atlantic, California, and Pacific Ocean; and of course, she is popular, maybe at the same point of Charles Lindbergh a few years ago. Who know how far can a celebrity help the cause of the army? Can she incite the population to join us? Even after ten years of existence, the U.S.A.A.C is not gigantic like the U.S Army or the U.S. Navy, and we really need everyone who is willing to fight on our side.\n\nOn the other side, Mrs. Earhart is just a citizen, not a soldier. She knows how to pilot planes, but how can we be sure she has the will to go and fight? How many time will it take to teach her about all the military terms? Lastly, there are even some in the army who will say that a woman cannot be sent into battle, saying that the army is not a playground, and that famous people have no business being here.\n\nThe final choice, of course, is up to the recruiting officer:\n\n“Mrs. Earhart, your request to join the U.S.A.A.C is ...”"

You'll all have to put up with me for at least another four years!” The assembled onlookers laughed.\n\nVincent Astor's yacht, the Nourmahal, awaited her passenger in the background, Miami's winter sun reflecting off her white hull. In a few minutes, Roosevelt would board, along with a small group of personal friends and political allies.\n\nTheir opulence disgusted him.\n\nThe anarchist surged toward the front of the crowd, his hidden hand tracing the machined steel contours of the eight-dollar revolver.\n\nAs the crowd began to disperse, Roosevelt turned to Chicago Mayor Tony Cermak, ready to depart.\n\n”Too many people are starving!”, Five deafening gunshots rang out, transforming the small-talking crowd into a screaming mob. Four bullets flew wildly into the horde, striking three fleeing Miamians and a security guard.

But while Roosevelt got away unharmed, five other people were gravely wounded, with Anton Cermak, Mayor of Chicago, unlikely to survive his injuries. \n\nThe would-be assassin has been identified as Giuseppe Zangara, an Italian immigrant who had hoped to kill Roosevelt, for reasons still unknown, with a revolver he had bought a few days earlier. His plan failed, however when several bystanders grabbed his arm, after the first shot leaving Zangra to wildly discard four shots into the crowd, each injuring a bystander, before being wrestled to ground. \n\nWhile the assassination-attempt is a traumatizing event for many politicians and attendees, many others are glad that Roosevelt was not harmed and will assume his office in a few months."

 USA_Elections_1932.1.t: "Franklin Roosevelt Inaugurated 32nd President"
 USA_Elections_1932.1.d: "[USA.GetNewsIcon]Today the inauguration of the Democratic candidate for the Presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, was held. With his hand over the 250-year old Dutch Bible, Roosevelt took the presidential oath to Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes on the Senate chamber of the United States Capitol in Washington D.C., thus becoming the 32nd President of the United States. He then delivered a memorable twenty minute-long inaugural address, where he addressed the many economic problems affecting the American nation. Roosevelt emphasized the necessity of strong and vigorous leadership, asking for the support of the people in these dark times. He also accused the bankers and the financial sector of allowing the economic crisis to happen for their own incompetence and their unscrupulous greed, calling for regulations on the banking and business sectors. Referring to the high unemployment rate, Roosevelt lamented the thousands of families losing their savings and stated the need for quick and decisive action to ”put people back to work.” He briefly touched the issue of foreign policy, compromising to continue good relations with other countries, and ended his speech by requesting the Congress grant full executive powers to deal with the economic emergency.\n\nThe speech was very positively received by the American public, with a woman calling the President someone ”worthy of every ounce of support a true American has.” Many Americans feel that his rhetoric is pretty convincing and dynamic, making a big contrast with the past residents of the White House. It looks Roosevelt represents the change that America so desperately needs right now. Only time will tell if he'll succeed in his endeavors."

 USA_Elections_1932.2.t: "The Wisconsin Progressive Party"
 USA_Elections_1932.2.d: "A significant event in Wisconsin politics occurred today with the formation of a new political force: the Wisconsin Progressive Party. Philip La Follette and his brother, Robert M. La Follette Jr., announced that the WPP would run in the state for the midterm elections this year, with the WPP becoming an alliance between Progressive Republicans in Wisconsin and the more radical labor groups. Other Republicans and even some Democrats have expressed concern about this, fearing that it will hurt their chances in the state, with some political analysts even speculating that they might band together to stop them, which seems unlikely.\n\nBoth of the La Follette brothers hope to use their new party as a platform to help them re-elect to their respective positions in government: Phillip as Governor of Wisconsin and Robert as Senator. Whether or not this occurs is up to voters, but the formation of a new political party certainly adds to the excitement of what promises to be an interesting midterm election season."
 USA_Elections_1932.2.A: "A force for good? Or just for political gain?"

 USA_Elections_1932.3.t: "The 1934 Midterm Elections: Democrats Gain"
 USA_Elections_1932.3.d: "The Midterm Elections have once again arrived, and while they aren't as large as a presidential election, many politicians and political analysts will be watching closely to see where the country is at during the current President's tenure.\n\nIt's good news for Democrats, who have gained seats in both the House and Senate, further solidifying their congressional majority. It is the first time since the Civil War that an incumbent President's party has gained seats in a midterm election, which the Democrats will celebrate because it allows them to continue with their domestic agenda.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, the Republicans fared poorly, losing seats to Democrats and even Progressives. It remains to be seen how they will recover from this, but they will need to come up with a plan quickly if they are to win the next election."
 USA_Elections_1932.3.A: "A resounding success for the Democrats!"

 USA_Elections_1932.4.t: "The 1934 Midterm Elections"
 USA_Elections_1932.4.d: "The Midterm Elections have once again arrived, and while they aren't as large as a presidential election, many politicians and political analysts will be watching closely to see where the country is at during the current President's tenure.\n\nNo party made any overall gains in Congress, which will undoubtedly be interpreted differently by each side. The Democrats will be pleased because they will continue to govern with a reasonable majority, though they will be disappointed that they did not achieve the gains they expected due to their domestic policies. There may even be reason to reconsider how it is implemented in the future.\n\nRepublicans are pleased that they suffered no overall losses, but they are said to be disappointed that they were unable to make a significant dent in the Democratic hold on Congress. It is up to them to decide how to proceed now, but action must be swift if they are to gain public support."
 USA_Elections_1932.4.A: "A stalemate on the political battlefield."

 USA_Elections_1932.5.t: "The 1934 Midterm Elections"
 USA_Elections_1932.5.d: "The Midterm Elections have once again arrived, and while they aren't as large as a presidential election, many politicians and political analysts will be watching closely to see where the country is at during the current President's tenure.\n\nIt's good news for Republicans, who have gained seats in both the House and Senate, weakening the Democratic majority in Congress. The Republicans will rejoice because polls predicted that they would lose more seats than they would gain, owing to what was thought to be the popular implementation of the Democrats' domestic agenda.\n\nHowever, the Democrats performed poorly, losing seats to Republicans and failing to prevent the Progressives from winning in Wisconsin. This could be an early indication that their plans were not as well received by voters as they had hoped, with some concerned about the implications for the 1936 Presidential election. It remains to be seen how they will recover from this, but they will need to come up with a plan quickly if they want to remain in power the next time."

 USA_Elections_1932.6.t: "Secretary of the Treasury William H. Woodin Has Resigned"
 USA_Elections_1932.6.d: "The two men looked across the large maple desk at each other. Nearly a year of work had gone on in and around that desk, all in an attempt to follow through on their promise to cure the ailments that the nation was experiencing. On one side of the desk was the Secretary of the Treasury, William H. Woodin, the quintessential image of an effective bureaucrat and businessman. When he first took office with the man across from him, the President, he was full of energy, optimism, and life, but over the course of the year, he had become weary, and tired of it all.\n ”Mr. President I am sad to be here today to give you this news but I am afraid I no longer feel I am fit to execute my duties as your Secretary of the Treasury.”\n ”I see, and what makes you believe this?" The President had expected something like this. He too had seen Woodin's fading enthusiasm.\n ”I’m not a young man any more sir, and my doctors have been telling me to slow down. I can feel it in my bones that they’re right.” Silence filled the room.\n ”You'll be leaving some big shoes to fill." The President pulled out a lighter and lit a fresh cigarette. ”Any ideas on who'll fill them?”\n ”There's a multitude of men in your camp and in my department I could recommend, but the best that comes to mind at present is Henry Morgenthau Jr. You're familiar with him and his work already from his time in Albany with you, and he's done a good job on the Federal Farm Board. He's behind you on the New Deal and he’s committed to keeping the operation as clean as possible.”\n ”A good choice. I’ll have to sleep on it of course, but I think he's the man I'll put in,” the President said, puffing smoke clouds towards the view of the Capitol.\n ”Well then, if there's nothing else, I do have a few more duties to complete before I leave.”"
 USA_Elections_1932.6.A: "It's been a pleasure, William."

 ### US 1936 Elections Events
 USA_Elections_1936.1.t: "The 1936 Republican National Convention"
 USA_Elections_1936.1.d: "With Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s victory in the 1932 election and the end of the Republican Party’s sixteen-year hold on the White House, the situation the country finds itself in seems to have improved. Roosevelt has unified the Democratic Party behind him, and the Republican Party must do the same if they are to occupy the Oval Office once more. In this year's GOP National Convention, there were initially three likely candidates, but as one, namely Senator William Borah is fading, the race is now between two men.\n\nThe first of these two men, Governor Alf Landon of Kansas, is a wealthy businessman and centrist. He is not only the most likely to win the nomination but also may have the greatest chance at defeating Roosevelt in the election, as he is not advocating for the abandonment of the New Deal programs that are providing relief to the economy. The second man is someone the people of America know well, the now-former president, Herbert Hoover. His hopes for nomination are thin, but with his significant political connections, it isn’t impossible for him to leech support off smaller candidates and surpass Landon.\n\nWhoever the Republican nominee is will be responsible with ensuring the party’s dominance in the future, but if they fail, Roosevelt and the Democratic Party will surely capitalise on that error and cement their position in American politics for years to come."

 USA_Elections_1936.2.t: "The 1936 Democratic National Convention"
 USA_Elections_1936.2.d: "There is no question.\n\nThe past three years under the Roosevelt Administration have proven prosperous, even in the harsh reality Columbia finds herself in. Whatever failures Hoover achieved through his reliance on the Invisible Hand began to get rectified; the mistakes he made were nothing in comparison to the success the New Deal has brought to the poverty stricken landscape. No challenger could even dare battle the President for the nomination.\n\nAnd Franklin Delano Roosevelt vows to go even further. In his acceptance speech, Roosevelt spoke to the everyday worker, those in the crowd the great Depression hurt the most. He spoke to their hearts, guaranteeing them he would fight for them. Not the corporations and banks that lowered the workers’ heads and diminished their pride, but the workers themselves, who will soon be able to stand upright and live in and for a country that cherishes them.\n\nBut the inner thoughts of the nominee held something different. Roosevelt knew he needed to change his approach; he knew the New Deal was not all it was cracked up to be. But Mr. Roosevelt would have the time to think it over. He had no need of campaigning; the Republican candidate could never surpass the love the people felt for him."

 USA_Elections_1936.3.t: "Election Night 1936"
 USA_Elections_1936.3.d: "The last presidential election ballots are being counted tonight. The electorate is familiar with both candidates: Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who ran for reelection as the President of the New Deal, who has rebuilt the country in recent years, and his opponent, former President Herbert Hoover, who served during the Great Depression.\n\nDespite his humanitarian ideas, Hoover has yet to reclaim his place in the hearts of Americans. As the night progresses, the gap between the two candidates grows wider and wider, favoring Roosevelt even more.\n\nAfter a long night of counting ballots, the results are in, and Franklin Roosevelt is re-elected with a comfortable majority, having received most of the votes of the electoral colleges, as well as an overwhelming majority of citizens' votes.\n\nClearly, Hoover's triumphant return to politics was not going to happen this year, and some wondered if his defeat would signal the end of his career."
 USA_Elections_1936.3.A: "Herbert never stood a chance against Franklin."

 USA_Elections_1936.4.t: "Election Night 1936"
 USA_Elections_1936.4.d: "Four years after FDR's historic landslide victory over then-President Herbert Hoover, the 1936 election has finally arrived. Much has changed since 1932, with the New Deal helping to alleviate some of our nation's problems caused by the Great Depression. Millions of people have found work as a result of this, primarily through government plans for public works on roads, dams, and highways. Despite the President's efforts, many in the country are still dissatisfied with the slow pace of recovery, which Alf Landon, the Republican nominee for President, has emphasized in his campaign.\n\nThe nation is on edge as the votes are counted and the outcome is awaited. While many predict that FDR will easily win a second term, a few polls have indicated a much closer race, with a couple even giving Alf Landon the election. The announcer says as the radio crackles..."

 USA_Elections_1936.5.t: "Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Second Inauguration"
 USA_Elections_1936.5.d: "[USA.GetNewsIcon]It’s a damp and dreary morning for such a momentous day in our nation. Despite the rain and mild cold, hundreds have taken to the streets of Washington to make their way to the east portico of the Capitol. Franklin Delano Roosevelt will be inaugurated for his second and probably last term as President of the United States. Vice President Garner will also be sworn in for his second term. The Chief Justice is presiding over the ceremonies.\n\nThis event will be the first test of the twentieth amendment, or the XX Provision. While it created rules on congressional term limits and potential electoral college deadlocks, chiefly, the Amendment has reduced the "lame-duck" period until the next Administration arrives. As such, January will be the new month for the transition of power, rather than March. Future presidents will have to have a good stock of coats to bear the potential icy Washington wind. But most see the change as good, making the transfer of power more efficient and swift.\n\nIt has been a tumultuous and eventful first term for FDR, but having easily won reelection back in November, the President is preparing another round of New Deal proposals, some more groundbreaking than his first term. And while the weather is tough on this bleary day in January, the sun is seemingly shining upon Roosevelt's fortunes for the next four years."
 USA_Elections_1936.5.A: "Surely things will go just fine!"

 USA_Elections_1936.6.t: "The Inauguration of President Landon"
 USA_Elections_1936.6.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Come storm or shine, the steps of the U.S. Capital has graced many presidents on their inauguration days. And now, so too do they guide Governor Alf Landon of Kansas. Landon took the Oath of Office just after noon today, becoming the 33rd President of the United States, in the pouring rain.\n\nDespite many pollsters predicting a win for FDR, most notably down to his popular New Deal, the race had been much closer, and Alf Landon had surprised many by coming out on top. He turned out to be an effective campaigner and ran as a more centrist member of the GOP, trying to win back those who had voted Democrat, 4 years prior. Rust Belt states like Pennsylvania and Ohio, had results that were on a knife-edge and only just tilted towards Alf in the last moments, winning the popular vote by just over a million.\n\nLandon is expected to take a more moderate stance than the mainstream Republican Party. While some New Deal repeals are likely to come from the White House, the President seems poised to find a middle ground between the program and American business interests. Playing on pure domestic politics, his foreign policies remain to be seen. \n\nNevertheless, hopefully, the American recovery will continue. With a different man at the top."

 USA_Elections_1936.7.t: "The Future of the Wisconsin Progressive Party"
 USA_Elections_1936.7.d: "It is no secret that the Wisconsin Progressive Party has had unexpected success in the state, and that a debate about how the party should proceed into the future of American politics has begun. Two camps have formed, each with their own ideas and opinions about what the WPP's next steps should be.\n\nThe first side contends that the WPP should be expanded to champion progressive ideas across the country rather than just in Wisconsin. This would be a massive political undertaking, but if they can replicate their success elsewhere, they may be able to compete with the Democrats and Republicans someday.\n\nThe other side claims that a merger with the Farmer-Labor Party would be much better for progressive issues. Supporters argue that forming a single stronger and more united progressive party would be preferable to having multiple parties that could be weaker and less likely to win. However, the two parties disagree on a few issues, so some compromises may be required.\n\nWhatever the party decides will undoubtedly have consequences not only for the state of Wisconsin, but potentially for the entire country, and both Democrats and Republicans will be watching what happens with bated breath."

 USA_Elections_1936.8.d: "Following defeats in the Wisconsin State Senate during the 1934 midterm elections and the 1936 presidential election, both Republicans and Democrats have been attempting to find a way to loosen the Wisconsin Progressive Party's grip on the state. Their plans appear to have collided now, as both parties have declared that they will form a "unified front," working together to retake the state senate from the WPP.\n\nWhile Republicans and Democrats have occasionally worked together on policy, forming an electoral alliance against a party much smaller than them has surprised some, as it is often a state heavily contested by the two parties. Others are unsurprised by the announcement, given that the WPP's popularity has been a thorn in the sides of the two major parties for nearly four years."

 USA_Elections_1936.9.d: "Following an intense debate within the Wisconsin Progressive Party over whether to expand or merge with the Farmer-Labor Party, the latter has been adopted as the party's formal decision. It has been argued that doing so will help to build a strong, united progressive front in the hopes of gaining more people's support.\n\nWhile the two parties do not agree on everything, they do agree that working together is the best way forward. It is unknown what they will do together, but it is highly likely that they will caucus with each other on certain votes, specifically in the Wisconsin State Senate and State Assembly.\n\nHow the major two parties will react is yet to be seen, as both the Democrats and the Republicans have been watching the developments closely. They will both hope that this does not jeopardise their chances of regaining control of Wisconsin, though a divided vote may make this more difficult."

While he has done well in recent years to try and hide his poor health, the recent 1944 election campaign has highlighted his need for extended periods of rest, mainly because of his high blood pressure and coronary artery disease. The main cause of his death has been stated as an “intracerebral hemorrhage” by the attending cardiologist Dr. Howard Bruenn.\n\nRoosevelt has achieved much during his time as President, with the New Deal being the most notable of his achievements. With his public works programs and the hefty government expenditure put into the economy, millions have been lifted out of unemployment and poverty, helping to create a better and more prosperous society.\n\nWhile it is not yet known who will take his place, it is highly likely that the Vice President, Harry Truman, will become the 33rd President at a time when the world is engulfed in uncertainty."

Despite the presence of several front-runners, including Robert Taft and Thomas Dewey, polls show Willkie with 44% of Republican support, far ahead of Dewey, who is in second place with 29%. Willkie has chosen Senate Minority Leader Charles McNary as his vice-presidential nominee, despite the fact that he was leading a "Stop Willkie" campaign. It remains to be seen whether the two will get along.\n\nWillkie is scheduled to deliver an acceptance speech, which will be televised locally.

Furthermore, many believe that New Deal politics could be improved with a fully recovered economy, and there was clearly no better candidate to compete with Franklin Roosevelt.\n\nIn a heartfelt speech of thanks to his Democratic colleagues, Franklin promised the party that he would continue his economic reforms and do everything in his power to keep America neutral in the upcoming European conflicts."

 USA_Elections_1944.4.d: "Today, on a cold January day, President-elect Thomas E. Dewey has been inaugurated after beating Roosevelt in last November’s tense and close election. While the ceremony was scaled down due to ongoing austerity measures imposed by Roosevelt because of the war, with the event taking place at the White House instead of the Capitol, it did not diminish the joyous occasion for the new President and vice president, John W. Bricker. With 7,000 invited guests watching on, Chief Justice Harlan F. Stone administered the oath to Dewey, while Bricker took his oath from the now former vice president Henry A. Wallace. After this, Dewey proceeded to give a long speech, thanking those who supported him, as well as those in the public who voted for him. The President has promised to lead the USA through whatever tests come before it and fix what he called “mistakes made by Presidents who thought they were doing good”, signalling his opposition to the New Deal which he had called “Communist” in the past. Dewey had also wanted some sort of celebrations to take place as he did not want his achievement of defeating Roosevelt to go unnoticed, and so a small, watered-down parade took place later in the day, with the President hosting a gathering inside the White House afterwards.\n\nMany eyes of the world have also keenly watched this, as they wonder what to expect from the new President who has different ideas about how to run the nation. However, with conflict still raging on abroad, Dewey may find that he must put whatever domestic plans he has on hold until a way of keeping the peace in the world can be found."

 USA_Elections_1944.5.d: "Today, on a cold January day, President Roosevelt has been inaugurated for a record fourth term, the first time in the history of our great nation. While the ceremony was scaled down due to ongoing austerity measures because of the war, with the event taking place at the White House instead of the Capitol, it did not diminish the joyous occasion for the President and his new vice president, Harry S. Truman. With 7,000 invited guests watching on, Chief Justice Harlan F. Stone administered the oath to Roosevelt, while Truman took his oath from the now former vice president Henry A. Wallace. After this, Roosevelt proceeded to give a short speech, thanking those who supported him, as well as those in the public who voted for him. The President has promised to lead the USA through whatever tests come before it and continue to build a better and brighter country for all. Once the formalities were complete, Roosevelt hosted a gathering inside the White House, with the traditional parade and other events cancelled for the big day.\n\nMany eyes of the world have also keenly watched this, as they wonder what is yet to come from the President now entering his fourth term. However, with Roosevelt having been in declining health since 1940, there is speculation about how much more he must give, and whether his new vice president could find himself in the top job soon."

 USA_Fireside.1.d: "Democracy is under threat all over the world. With the fascist threat engulfing much of Europe and Japan striking deep into Asia, the situation for the cause of liberty for all could not be worse. Yet, in the United States, we have avoided all of the chaos, and we are in a relatively comfortable position, with the economy growing day by day. However, this does not mean that we should sit back and watch the world burn around us; as a fellow democracy to the UK, France, and other European nations, we must do our part to ensure that they can stand up to Hitler and his cronies.\n\nWhile full-fledged intervention is not in our best interests, there are other ways we can assist democratic nations around the world. We will be able to ramp up production of military equipment that can be sent all over the world by utilizing our ever-growing industry. Guns, tanks, bombers, fighter planes, and artillery pieces will almost certainly be gratefully received by those who need them the most. Our presence will be felt from the battlefields of China to the deserts of North Africa, even if we are not directly present.\n\nPresident Roosevelt has also addressed the nation on the arsenal of democracy, saying that "if Great Britain goes down, the Axis powers will control the continents of Europe, Asia, Africa, Australasia, and the high seas - and they will be able to bring enormous military and naval resources against this hemisphere," a stark warning for our nation that has been isolated for so long. At the end of his radio address, Roosevelt reassured the public, "I believe that the Axis powers will not win this war," which we all hope he is correct."

 USA_FDR_New_Deal.1.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]\nPresident Roosevelt hasn't been wasting time and only a couple of days after taking the oath, he issued Proclamation 2039 that stated the effective suspension of all banking transactions. \n\nThe proclamation states that no withdrawal, deposit, transfer and other banking operation of any kind of currency (including gold and silver) from any banking institution is going to be made in a week. \n\nWhile people remain concerned about their money, there is little panic and everyone is trying to deal with this situation the best they can.

 USA_FDR_New_Deal.2.d: "So it finally can proceed. In one of the most awaited moments since the inauguration, President Franklin D. Roosevelt has introduced the nation to the members of his administration, a group of talented men who will change the United States for the better.\n\nSecretary of State Cordell Hull will manage America's stance on the international stage. An internationalist, Hull will lead America's efforts to step out and finally involve itself in world affairs as an advocate for liberty and democracy. In a departure from US interventionism in Latin America, he hopes to make America a 'good neighbor' to Mexico and the South American countries.\n\nOn the left sits William Woodin, the Secretary of the Treasury. Woodin will be crucial in implementing New Deal policy, removing the dollar from the gold standard to increase American economic independence and promote GDP growth.\n\nThe new Secretary of the Interior, Harold L. Ickes, will support Woodin's efforts- a man who will probably be the most responsible for achieving the New Deal's promises across America. Of particular consequence is the Public Works Administration- an institution that will come to aid thousands, if not millions, of Americans in search of a job and good pay.\n\nOther notable appointees include Homer Stille Cummings as Attorney General, serving as the President's legal advisor and lawyer for the Federal Government, and James Farley as the Postmaster-General, head of the United States Postal Service."

 USA_FDR_New_Deal.3.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Today, in a joint session of Congress, the Emergency Banking Act has been passed and signed by us, which is a great success for our administration.\n\nIt is no surprise that the banks were hit hard during the initial days of the Great Depression, and since then, confidence and stability have never returned in large amounts. Today that changes, and this act should help us to slowly begin to move forward out of the economic crisis. A four-day bank holiday was declared a few days ago, which shut all banks until congress could act to solve the problem. This has also allowed us to inspect the banks to see which ones could be saved and which ones, unfortunately, had to be closed. We are thankful to both the House and the Senate for passing this Act swiftly, and it seems they saw the urgency for this to be introduced as well.\n\nIt has also been decided that it will be a good idea to explain to the people of America what is contained within this Act, and a “fireside chat” has been arranged to do this in a comforting and welcoming environment for those watching and listening from home. If it is well received, we could always do more of these fireside chats to truly connect with the nation.\n\nThis is only meant to be a short-term solution to the initial problem posed, and hopefully, soon we will be able to introduce new legislation to reinforce this. But for now, the Emergency Banking Act will bring some stability to people’s lives, and something we hope to do more of with our plans to save the American economy."

While the nation is certainly not the first Great Power to abandon the Standard, it is certainly one of the most impactful to do so. Practically every civilized society on Earth felt the pain of the Black Tuesday stock market crash of 1929, showing just how easy Lady Liberty’s woes are to spread.\n\nWith American Gold now set to return to the US Federal Reserve, more Dollars can now be printed and unleashed into the global market. While the United States has a ways to go before consumer confidence is completely restored, it is a step in the right direction nonetheless.

 USA_FDR_New_Deal.5.d: "In the midst of the Depression, tensions run high between corporations, the government, and those working under such machinations of entrepreneurship. Large businesses shouldered the brunt of the blame for the Depression’s initial effects, failing to provide for their employees and thus causing millions of young men and women to go unemployed. Indeed, the nation’s economics are in a constant state of turmoil, only compounded by class tensions. Such an instance of this has been seen constantly over the past two years. Certain influential businessmen have expressed outrage over the current political state of affairs, stating that the New Deal unjustly targets large businesses with underhanded means such as anti-trust laws or special progressive taxes. Although angered, it is unlikely they will be able to manage much except disrupting the economic stability further than previously thought possible."

Acquired just over 30 years ago, Puerto Rico has never been a particularly prosperous territory. However, with its rather large population, we cannot simply ignore the tumultuous situation. Even before the disastrous ’20s, the island territory has faced nearly unlivable conditions, with their primary exports being controlled by oligopolies and tycoons unwilling to pay wages to the Puerto Ricans working the plantations. This is compounded by the fact that the sugar industry was hit particularly hard by the Great Depression, with fewer and fewer people having disposable income to purchase sugar products. All in all, the situation for Puerto Rico is dire, and we must establish an Alphabet Agency to deal with it. The Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration will divert government resources into the rebuilding of the island to ensure long-term economic stability and conditions suitable for Americans."

The same veterans who were protesting in the streets of Washington D.C. in 1932 because they could not claim what they were rightfully owed, can now begin to withdraw money that will surely help them in these challenging times.\n\nAs with many millions across the country, the veterans found themselves in the dark pit of unemployment, and without the ability to redeem cash from their service certificates until 1948, anger culminated in the protests seen in 1932, which ended with the army dissolving the demonstration. The Great Depression still bears down hard on our nation, so the threat of this happening again was high, which has led Congress to decide to act decisively. \n\nThe passing of the Adjusted Compensation Payment Act is not surprising, as we hold both chambers of Congress, leading to a large majority in favour of this. Payments will now begin to roll out across the nation, which could total up to $2 billion.\n\nAs for the veterans? They seem to be most pleased. They have fought and won the Great War, and now they seem to have won a “war” with the Federal Government over their bonuses. This must be a lesson that veterans of any conflict we fight in must be treated fairly by all."

They have sought to manipulate our nations for their own political, diplomatic and economic gains. It is safe to say, trust in any American efforts in regard to us, are nonexistent.\n\nHowever, Franklin Roosevelt, the newly elected President of the United States, has called for a policy of realignment in his foreign policy. Calling it the ‘Good Neighbor’ policy, the President is proposing a withdrawal of the current military mission to Haiti and normalizing relations with Mexico, Cuba and the rest of the Latin nations. He also proposed new commerce and exchange deals as a way to bolster the novel strategy.\n\nWhile the details of the negotiations are yet to be hashed together, we know one thing. It will take more than just lucrative economic opportunities and a reset of relations to return our trust in Uncle Sam. We have been betrayed before and it could just as easily happen again. A concerted and serious effort will be required, by this new administration, to return the United States to good standing anywhere south of the Rio Grande."

The treaty underlines the importance that all signatories were recognised as equal sovereign states, and that members would not interfere with the foreign or domestic policies of another state.\n\nThis is a great achievement for US foreign affairs and comes under the greater scope of the Good Neighbour policy set out by President Roosevelt. It was also a historical day as the first female representative of the US was present at the signing of the treaty.\n\nIn total, 19 nations signed the convention, while 3 others accepting it with minor reservations, one of these countries being the United States, with Bolivia being the only country that did not sign. \n\nSome outside observers wonder if this will help the USA’s doctrine of Neutrality, as non-intervention was agreed within the treaty, which would help secure the US’s place within the New World."

Countries come and go, but the American Experiment has seen through strife, turmoil and even Civil War. While our fortune has been great and the nation has endured, unfortunately, our destiny has manifested in ways that the founders could call tyrannical too. Previous administrations have led several military interventions into our Latin American neighbors, in at least 8 different nations. Some of those, several times. Expectedly, trust in American values in our backyard is at an all-time low.\n\nHowever, with FDR now the Commander-in-Chief, the new administration is proposing a full reset on southern relations. Calling it the ‘Good Neighbor’ policy, the President is prepared to withdraw the remaining military mission to Haiti and the normalization of relations with Mexico and Cuba.Stating in his inaugural address, Roosevelt proclaimed ”I would dedicate this nation to the policy of the good neighbor, the neighbor who resolutely respects himself and, because he does so, respects the rights of others.” This has also been stated by Secretary of State Hull, saying ”No country has the right to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another.”\n\nThis policy of non-intervention includes lucrative trade deals for Central American nations, hoping to add a level of trust to the new relationships. However, decades of interventions and bullying cannot be fixed with trades and a speech. It will be a real test of this administration’s diplomacy to restore America’s standing in these nations."

Order 6102 now forbids "the hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates within the continental United States," effectively taking the country off the Standard of Gold. It is a monumental order, but one in lockstep with Roosevelt’s First 100 Days plan, carrying with it the hope to pull this country out of the steepest depression in our history.\n\nConsumers have been hoarding gold since the stock market began to collapse, a nature of these hard times. While most can’t be blamed for keeping their money close to the chest, it has only worsened economic spending and has devalued prices. By trading in their gold for a currency amount, the order will give more liquidity to spenders. It also will remove a constraint on the Federal Reserve, with demand notes requiring a 40% gold backing, raising their credit-issuing ceiling and allowing more currency to be printed.\n\nCitizens have until May 1st to bring in their gold deposits, where they will receive an exchange for banknotes at $20.67 per troy ounce."

 USA_FDR_1936.1.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]An amendment to the historic Social Security Act of 1935 was added today. Building on the historic law, changes have been made to increase the number of people assisted by benefit payments. The revision now allows retired workers' spouses and children to receive payments, as well as the family to receive payments in the event of an unexpected death if the worker is covered by the Social Security Act. Because of its scale, some have referred to this as "the second Social Security Act," with the act shifting from worker-based to more family-oriented.\n\nThe amendment also brought about some smaller, but more noticeable changes, such as an increase in the amount paid by social security and a move of the start of monthly payments to 1940. While other changes may be made in the future, none will be as significant as the one made today."

 USA_FDR_1936.2.d: "The Neutrality Act of 1935 provided a solid foundation for our isolationist foreign policy, and it was widely supported by the public, who did not want to become involved in wars in which we had no place. An updated version of the act has now been accepted, with one feature that has piqued the interest of many: the implementation of cash and carry provisions.\n\nThe first Neutrality Act prohibited the sale of arms to any country involved in a war, and the second will do the same, though some changes have been made due to the new provision. Nations at war will now be able to purchase goods from the United States in addition to weapons and arms. Raw materials such as oil, which is desperately needed by nations with large navies such as the United Kingdom, will be available for purchase, but buyers must not only provide their own ships for transportation, but they are also only permitted to purchase these goods in cash.\n\nWith the cash and carry provisions now included in the Neutrality Act 1937, we will not only be able to support democratic nations in this manner, but we will also make some money, which we hope to put to good use in domestic affairs. The cash and carry provisions currently have a two-year time limit, so whether we choose to renew them later is not a decision we need to make right now."

The Act also includes restrictions on what work children can and cannot do, as well as raises for nearly 700,000 workers. Some groups, however, such as executives and seasonal workers, are not covered by this legislation.\n\nThe President declared after signing the Act that it was "the most important piece of New Deal legislation since the Social Security Act of 1935," and it may well prove to be so in the future."

Many isolationist members of Congress saw any revisions to the prior act as a method to pull the United States into a large-scale European battle.\n\nThe law originally intended for a limited re-implementation of "Cash and Carry." The "Cash and Carry" policy permitted hostile countries to buy non-military commodities in exchange for cash and full transportation responsibility.\n\nThat all changed when German tanks crossed the Polish border.\n\nNew clauses in the act allowed the sale of weaponry to warring states; however, the use of loans and American shipping remained barred. As a result of Germany's increasing aggression, many members of Congress changed their opinions, and the bill was carried by a vote of 243-181.\n\nDuring the removal of the weapons embargo, Nebraska Independent Senator George W.

Official reports state that we made a decent amount of money from the scheme, some of which we funneled into our economy and armed forces after providing numerous countries with numerous amounts of raw materials for whatever their purposes may be.\n\nDespite the end of cash and carry, the situation in Europe and other parts of the world, such as Asia, remains extremely tense, with some predicting war at any moment. If we can find a way to help democracies around the world by trading raw materials for cash, the provisions may be useful to bring back in the future, and we will undoubtedly benefit from it."

 USA_Packing_the_Courts.1.t: "The Judicial Procedures Reform Bill"
 USA_Packing_the_Courts.1.d: "The biggest obstacle to implement the progressive legislation necessary to restart the economy and improve the life quality of the American people comes from the Supreme Court. The conservative justices known as ”the Four Horsemen” are attempting to block any legislation regarding the New Deal, using arguments regarding constitutional jurisprudence and legal formalism.\n\nThese excuses, based on archaic formalist and fiscally conservative views are only delaying future economic and social expansion plans. After various failed attempts to introduce legislation regarding this issue, the reelection of President Roosevelt presents a perfect opportunity to reform the federal judiciary.The Judicial Procedures Reform Bill proposed by Roosevelt grants the President the ability to appoint new judges of the Supreme Court for each federal judge that reaches the age of seventy, and didn’t retire within six months.\n\n However, the bill also limits this power to six judges in the Supreme Court and two on the lower federal courts. Also, it establishes proctors on the Supreme Court to administer the lower courts. If we manage to pass the bill, we can finally overcome these obstacles that have been delaying America’s path to a better future."

The population still views the Supreme Court as an institution that protects the values written in the Constitution, and any kind of intervention is perceived as authoritarian and unconstitutional. Some scholars even argued that the bill could be a potential danger to the rights of the people.\n\nThe reaction of the media was very sceptical, even from the newspapers favorable to us, arguing that, while there the bill has some merit, it could also cause a breakdown of the judicial system.

The President started by arguing that fixing the inequalities of the system was necessary to avoid the mistakes that led to the depression, pointing out the effort of Congress to ratify legislation regarding economic recovery.\n\nHe then criticized the Supreme Court for trying to sabotage this legislation. Speaking in metaphorical terms, Roosevelt referred to the American form of government as a three-horse team, describing the judicial system as the third horse that is delaying the other two.\n\nThe President stated the Supreme Court was functioning improperly, misinterpreting the Constitution to follow their agenda. He also listed the advantages of judicial reform, that it will allow for a cheaper, speedier, and effective administration of the system of justice. After empathizing that there is nothing radical on his proposal because it was already a kind of policy implemented by prior presidents, he ended the address by making clear his intention to restore the balance to three branches of power.

In addition to this backlash, one Progressive editorialist accused the President of trying to fake an appearance of sincerity on his address to take away the rights of the American people.

Senator Ashurst is known for being a very skilled public speaker, making thousands of speeches with a varied and sophisticated vocabulary.\n\nBeloved by the people of Arizona, he has a good reputation for putting the interests of his constituents above anything else. However, the Senator is also infamous for constantly switching political positions. His inconsistent and eccentric record tarnish what is otherwise an impeccable career, as he voted both for and against Prohibition and stated contradictory opinions regarding the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill that he is now holding up.

When asked about this slowness, the Arizonian senator bizarrely referred to the motto of the committee: "No haste, no hurry, no waste, no worry”.

Democratic Senator for Arkansas and Senate Majority Leader Joseph Taylor Robinson has been found dead today on the floor of his Maryland Avenue apartment. This wasn't a complete surprise, as the senator was already experiencing the strain from his advanced age and the pressure of the Senate hearings, suffering from constant chest pains.\n\nIt is expected that a funeral will be organized in the Senate chamber in a few days, where his family, friends, and colleagues will pay their respects. While the death of the senator is already bad for the party leadership, it also hinders the progress of our judicial agenda.\n\nMajority Leader Robinson was not only one of the biggest supporters of the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill but of the president's New Deal initiatives, doing everything in his power to get the number of votes necessary. Without him passionately defending the bill and our government, our chances of success are greatly reduced."

 USA_Packing_the_Courts.12.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]The ferocious battle to reform the Supreme Court is finally over. The Judicial Procedures Reform Bill was passed on the Senate, allowing the President to appoint new justices to the Supreme Court. Despite many politicians heavily criticizing the bill as an attempt to stack the court through unconstitutional means, most of the Democrats supported the party line and voted in favor of it.\n\nRepublican politicians are furious at the result, calling this bill ”a step further into authoritarianism”. Numerous opponents of the President (including Chief Justice Hughes) have threatened with resignation if these changes are implemented. However, it is believed that his words lack any real substance.\n\nWith Roosevelt's plan for judicial reform implemented, his administration's political capital is at an all-time high, and they are now capable of expanding the New Deal beyond even their most generous expectations.

For now, the judicial reform initiative will likely go back to the committee where the necessary changes will be made to at least pass a modified version of it.\n\nThe loss of political capital that will result from this defeat could even put in danger the integrity of the President's New Deal initiatives, empowering the it's staunch opponents.

 ### The Motives of the Vice President
 USA_Packing_the_Courts_Aftermath.1.t: "The Motives of the Vice President"
 USA_Packing_the_Courts_Aftermath.1.d: "In the aftermath of the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill’s defeat, many staffers inside the executive branch have sought to deflect blame, lambasting congressmen for not supporting the President. However, Roosevelt himself has come to a more drastic conclusion, one suggesting meddling from within his own branch of government!\n\nNumerous executives have had troubles with their Vice-President’s over the decades, but Garner and Roosevelt’s relationship has been wrought with mistrust since the second term began! Garner has specifically disagreed with the President on many serious issues, including the Reform Bill! While Garner was crucial to the success of the New Deal at first, the Texan appears to just be much more conservative than we originally thought. Perhaps he has other motives than we currently know.\n\nSomeone must take the fall for the defeat, that much is certain. Several aides are calling for Roosevelt to immediately ask for Garner’s resignation. Removing a significant member of the branch will have serious consequences in soft power for the administration. That being said, Roosevelt has already made up his mind on a new VP pick for a potential third term, so Garner will be departing anyway. Perhaps allowing him to ease out while limiting his press time, would suffice to limit any further damage."
 USA_Packing_the_Courts_Aftermath.1.A: "Demand Garner’s resignation immediately!"
 USA_Packing_the_Courts_Aftermath.1.B: "Ease the Texan out to pasture..."

 USA_Packing_the_Courts_Aftermath.2.t: "Vice President John Nance Garner Resigns!"
 USA_Packing_the_Courts_Aftermath.2.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Earlier this morning, John Nance Garner, the 32nd Vice President, tendered his resignation to President Roosevelt and the Cabinet at large. Cactus Jack, as he was well known, had once been an invaluable asset to the Administration, providing a link to both the moderate and conservative factions of the Democratic Party. However, by the start of the President’s second term, Garner had begun to openly oppose portions of Roosevelt’s ambitious plans. With his withdrawal of support for the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill and its subsequent defeat in congress, Garner was expected to be replaced at the Democratic Convention at the least. However, his removal now signals exactly where the executive branch places the defeat’s blame.\n\nAt a time when the President needs as much support as he can muster, the resignation will not only open the door to a political battle for a new Vice President, but also make it that much harder to get any more legislation passed. With the more conservative faction of the party now adrift, Roosevelt will need to make a much more difficult decision on his 2nd in Command, and do it very quickly."
 USA_Packing_the_Courts_Aftermath.2.A: "With the Cactus gone, the political desert gets that much drier."
 
 USA_Packing_the_Courts_Aftermath.3.t: "Cactus Jack's Successor"
 USA_Packing_the_Courts_Aftermath.3.d: "While the President has survived the scandal with the courts, several key members of the Roosevelt administration have been forced out following recent events- the most significant of these was Vice President Garner, also known as Cactus Jack. With a crucial part of his cabinet missing, the President now has a position to fill- and a unique opportunity.\n\nPopular in the south and his home state of Texas, Garner was a compromise candidate who brought in votes and appeased the conservative wing of the party. Unfortunately, his vision for America's future was incompatible with the President's. Garner served his purpose, but with electoral victory already behind him, the President has a chance to pick a right-hand man more agreeable with his policy goals.\n\nSecretary of Agriculture Henry A. Wallace has spent two decades advocating for government intervention in the farming sector and has enthusiastically supported the New Deal since the beginning. As Vice President, he would have considerably more power to assist Roosevelt in implementing his economic program. On the other hand, Secretary of State Cordell Hull is a skilled diplomat with ties to Cactus Jack's old supporters, which could be instrumental in securing the support and votes of conservatives within the party.\n\nCordell Hull or Henry Wallace, pragmatism or idealism- time to play it safe or throw caution to the wind?\n\nThe President turns toward the door to the secretary's office, and Missy LeHand steps through it as if silently summoned. Roosevelt smiles."
 USA_Packing_the_Courts_Aftermath.3.A: "Missy, would you get Secretary Hull on the line?"
 USA_Packing_the_Courts_Aftermath.3.B: "Missy, would you have Secretary Wallace meet me?"

 USA_Packing_the_Courts_Aftermath.4.t: "Cordell Hull Appointed Vice President"
 USA_Packing_the_Courts_Aftermath.4.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]News from Washington today as President Roosevelt struggles to maintain his momentum after an unsightly string of high-profile resignations. In a brief press conference at the White House, the President announced that Secretary of State Cordell Hull, a native of Tenessee, would leave his position to take up the office of Vice President. Undersecretary Sumner Welles will take Hull's former cabinet post.\n\nMost political pundits view this move as an olive branch to the Moderate wing of the party, which had begun to distance itself from Roosevelt's New Dealers. While this has undoubtedly shored up the President's position in the party somewhat, it seems unlikely that Democrats will ever trust him as they once did."
 USA_Packing_the_Courts_Aftermath.4.A: "A step towards reconciliation, but is it enough?"

 USA_Packing_the_Courts_Aftermath.5.t: "Henry Wallace Appointed Vice President"
 USA_Packing_the_Courts_Aftermath.5.d: "[USA.GetNewsIcon]President Roosevelt himself is expected to announce the successor to John Nance Garner in a matter of moments. While many Americans already have an idea who will fill the Vice President’s role, many are wondering just how much of a successor he will actually be!\n\nHenry A. Wallace, Secretary of Agriculture, will be elevated to 2nd in Command of the United States. Wallace, a self proclaimed progressive, is the ideological opposite of the former VP, an expected move after his fervent opposition to many of the President’s programs. An ardent supporter of the New Deal and a skilled bureaucrat under the Agricultural Department, Wallace is likely to have a smooth transition into the role, something the Administration needs desperately. Finding a pillar of support outside the mainstream party is crucial to Roosevelt’s election chances, and the executive branch knows that.\n\nHowever, Wallace’s devout liberal tendencies, and somewhat odd personal habits, have made him an easy target for more moderate democrats over the years. Roosevelt is already treading on thin ice after Garner’s removal, with many conservatives already considering propping up another candidate in opposition to the President. It is yet to be seen what will happen at the Convention, but after this likely designation, the Executives will have a steep uphill battle to win control of the party for an unprecedented third term.\n\nMembers of the DNC are now approaching the podium, with the Chairman, Senate and House leaders in attendance. And now, here is President Roosevelt up to the microphone..."

 ### Army events
 USA_Army.1.t: "The Selective Training Act"
 USA_Army.1.d: "Amidst growing tensions, the United States must be prepared in the event of global war. Upon these shifting tides rests a giant, lightly dozing but slowly opening its eyes. The first peacetime conscription in American history has just been enacted, expected to bring an additional nine-hundred thousand soldiers into the army. All eligible men between the ages of 21 and 45 are subject to the draft, ensuring we have a strong manpower reserve in the event of open warfare. Despite growing complaints, this act has been met with little resistance, with primarily pacifist factions opposing the acts. However, in the end, it is America’s job to uphold global democracy, and thus it shall do so.\nTo stay the steady hand of objection, the act includes a clause regarding conscientious objection, allowing any citizen to deny military service for religious or medical reasons if any are present. Thus, whilst conscription has been implemented in the United States, our army shall remain that of volunteers, ensuring the liberty of Americans as well as those foreigners we deign to protect."
 USA_Army.1.A: "Let us hope we needn't employ such reserves."

 USA_Army.2.t: "Federalization of the National Guard"
 USA_Army.2.d: "Following several years of military buildup, we find ourselves lagging behind in active-duty soldiers for the US Army. That changes now. Though historically the National Guard has fought for individual states, their recent reclassification as members of the US Army in addition to their state role has prepared us to make the final decision to centralize the military. As of today, four-hundred thousand members of the National Guard have been called up to report to their units, effectively doubling the size of the US Army. 18 divisions and various other forces have been federalized for service in this time of national emergency. A rifle is only as good as the man firing it, thus we cannot subsist on industry alone. These hundreds of thousands of trained men will vastly expand the fighting capabilities of the army, ensuring that we will not have to resort to deploying reserves for quite some time."
 USA_Army.2.A: "Let us hope we needn't employ such reserves."
 USA_Army.2.A: "These new soldiers shall win the day."

 USA_Army.3.t: "The Louisiana Maneuvers"
 USA_Army.3.d: "The onset of war seems inevitable for America, and thus we need to get our army into fighting shape. The US Army has not seen active combat since the ending of the Great War, thus we must first evaluate the current logistical and doctrinal status of our main fighting force, some four-hundred thousand soldiers, as well as the effectiveness of our command structure. The plan includes large-scale maneuvers stretching from the Sabine River to the Calcasieu, with dozens of high-ranking officers present to oversee such events. Though such events will be costly, it is necessary to determine the current fighting strength of the army and provide the soldiers some combat experience, even if simply staged. The exercises will pit the red army versus the blue, including armor groups, antitank groups, cavalry flanking divisions, and several air task forces.\nWith the conclusion of the maneuvers, we have learned a great deal. With a possible panzerkampf on the horizon, the necessity of tank destroyers has become apparent, with the majority of our defensive doctrine revolving around knocking out as many tanks as possible. An immobilized enemy cannot fight, and with much of our doctrine focused on mobile envelopment, the odds of an American victory look high."
 USA_Army.3.A: "A modernized American Army awaits."

 USA_Army.4.t: "Eisenhower's Grand Battleplan"
 USA_Army.4.d: "Dwight D. Eisenhower has witnessed many changes in the face of war over the last 20 years. Having served in the Great War, he excelled in demonstrating his brilliant organizational skills, eventually rising to the rank of major after the war. More recently, during the dark days at the start of the Great Depression, when money was tight and the army's budget was low, Eisenhower continued to plan for another war, which we hope never happens.\n\nThis doctrine, simply titled "The Grand Battleplan," argues for extensive planning and organization prior to any fighting, employing a strong defense to break the enemy before launching a massive assault to punch through their lines. Eisenhower also claims that an attack could be bolstered by using mechanized infantry and armored units, with much of the control coming from a single centralized command post.\n\nEisenhower has already proven his worth, and by giving his ideas the green light, we can begin to implement his reforms across the US Army, which will undoubtedly prepare us for any future conflicts that may arise."
 USA_Army.4.A: "Ike will ensure we will have tactical superiority on the battlefield!"

 USA_Army.5.t: "Marshall's Overwhelming Firepower"
 USA_Army.5.d: "Much can be said about George C. Marshall. A strategist, a soldier, and an excellent General, he has spent many years observing how the nature of warfare has changed, and he now may be a part of its future. Marshall spent much of his time as Army Chief of Staff between 1920 and 1924 working on ways to modernize and mechanize warfare, and after years in the making, his new doctrine has been presented to us with a simple, yet effective name: Overwhelming Firepower.\n\nIts main point is that artillery should be used as the driving force behind any attack or defense by our forces. Our infantry units will also try to stall any enemy advances so that by the time they reach our positions, they will be too weak to deal significant damage. Marshall's final plan is to use mechanized forces to blitz through the weakened enemy lines and deal the killing blow to their forces, ensuring victory in our battles.\n\nWhile it is far from perfect, Marshall has stated that he wishes to proceed so that he can implement his plans to identify and eliminate training flaws."
 USA_Army.5.A: "Let hell rain down: fire in the hold!"

 USA_Army.6.t: "Caution: Patton!"
 USA_Army.6.d: "General George S. Patton has been a key figure in the development of the army's armored warfare doctrine since the end of the Great War, serving in a variety of staff positions across the country. Patton's armored warfare doctrine is based on troops' ability to penetrate conventional defensive lines using maneuver by armored units. The use of tanks and related vehicles by other supporting arms such as infantry fighting vehicles, self-propelled artillery, and other combat vehicles, as well as mounted combat engineers and other support units, is critical to the application of armored warfare.\n\nThe doctrine of armored warfare was originally developed to break the static nature of trench warfare on the Western Front during the Great War, but its effectiveness continues to this day. As a result, it is time to embrace the future of warfare and reform our army doctrine to resemble Patton's.\n\nPatton's abilities and effectiveness as a General were demonstrated during the Great War, and his concepts of mechanized and armored warfare continue to impress. That fact, combined with the fear that another conflict is on the horizon, is why Patton has been officially promoted to Field Marshal."

 USA_Army.10.d: "Plunged into the chaos of war once more, America has seen its fair share of hardships, which only goes to steel our resolve. However, resolve alone cannot win a battle. We require adept and experienced leadership, and though we are certainly not short-handed, a veteran officer can just as certainly be useful. John J. Pershing, a four-star General of the Great War, has recently approached the president, offering to put his retirement on hold for the good of the nation. He requests reinstatement to his original rank--certainly not an unreasonable request. The issue arises in his methodology: though Pershing offers deft action and positive results, he brings with him unparalleled losses. A rigid and traditional tactician, we cannot afford to throw our men at the enemy with such carelessness. Is America truly so deprived of officers that we might resort to these methods?"
 USA_Army.10.A: "It wouldn't be a war without Pershing!"

 USA_Air_Force.1.d: "Claire Lee Chennault, also known as "Old Leatherface", is a military aviator and a fierce advocate of "pursuit" or fighter-interceptor aircraft. He learned to fly in the Army Air Service during the Great War and following the war he graduated from pursuit pilot training at Ellington Field, Texas, and remained in the service after it became the Air Corps in 1926. Chennault became the Chief of Pursuit Section at Air Corps Tactical School.\n\nHe has been attempting to modernize fighter tactics by emphasizing the use of airpower as a weapon. As a result, he frequently disagreed with and criticized General Joseph Stilwell for being overly reliant on infantry and underestimating the capabilities of airpower.\n\nWe have decided that Chennault is correct and that we must modernize our fighters as soon as possible in order to provide the airpower we require."
 USA_Air_Force.1.A: "We will dominate the skies."

 USA_Air_Force.2.t: "The Proper Composition Of the Air Force"
 USA_Air_Force.2.d: "George Churchill Kenney enlisted as a flying cadet in the Aviation Section of the United States Signal Corps in 1917 and served in the First World War, where he fought off German fighters and shot two of them down. After the war, he was commissioned into the Regular Army in 1920, where he attended the Air Corps Tactical School and later became an instructor. He was in charge of the acceptance of Martin NBS-1 bombers and even test flew them. He also devised methods for mounting.30 caliber machine guns on the wings of an Airco DH.4 aircraft.\n\nHe favors close air support and opposes the US focusing on strategic bombing, as proposed by Harold Lee George and his Bomber Mafia. He believes that the primary goal of the Air Force should be to support ground forces with fighters and light bombers by conducting airstrikes against hostile targets close to friendly forces.\n\nAlthough theorists and aviators frequently disagree about its strategic value, the close air support doctrine advances steadily. We've decided that, with Kenney's help, we'll begin shifting our air doctrine toward close air support."
 USA_Air_Force.2.A: "Supporting our ground forces is key."

 USA_Air_Force.3.t: "The Bomber Mafia Succeeds"
 USA_Air_Force.3.d: "When it comes to our Air Force, it is obvious that Harold Lee George and his Bomber Mafia have the right idea on what we should be focusing on.\n\nGeorge is one of our most capable Air Force Generals and an aviation pioneer and outspoken proponent of the industrial web theory. He believes that an enemy's industrial power can be attacked at weak points, potentially severely limiting the enemy's ability to wage a long war, as well as his morale and will to resist. He assisted in the refinement of precision daylight bomber doctrine and taught air tactics and precision bombing doctrine himself, eventually becoming the de facto leader of the powerful "Bomber Mafia." Together with Bomber Mafia members, George researched, debated, and codified "industrial web theory," which the men believed would be a war-winning strategy.\n\nWe will begin to listen to George and implement his industrial web theory, focusing heavily on bombers and vigorously promoting precision bombing doctrine."
 USA_Air_Force.3.A: "First, we destroy their industry, then their morale."

 USA_Air_Force.4.t: "Hap Arnold's Compromise"
 USA_Air_Force.4.d: "When it comes to our Air Force, Henry Harley Arnold, also known as \"Hap\" to his work associates, has the right idea on what we should be focusing on.\n\nArnold is widely regarded as a visionary who first articulated the importance of superior research and development capabilities in deterring and winning wars. His ideas have played an important role within the Air Force, and he has quickly risen through the ranks. Arnold promoted research and development, and some of his projects included the B-17 and the concept of jet-assisted takeoff.\n\nHe describes his wartime research and development philosophy as follows: \"Make some quality sacrifices in order to obtain enough quantity to supply all fighting units. Never follow the mirage of the perfect airplane to the point where fighting squadrons are short of fighter planes.\" Instead of focusing too much on quality or other types of planes such as bombers, he believes that we should first focus on having a large enough Air Force with enough fighters to assist and supply all fighting units.\n\nWe will start listening to Arnold and implement his ideas of focusing heavily on fighters in our Air Force."

The individual was none other than Clyde Barrow himself. Farris opened the door as he approached the steps, at the command of the officers. Clyde begged Farris not to shoot, but when he saw the officers in the front room, he pulled a sawed-off shotgun from under his coat and fired through the front window.Davis, who had been stationed on the back porch, heard the commotion and ran for the front of the house as the officers inside returned fire. When Davis saw Clyde, he ordered him to drop his weapon while drawing his pistol. Clyde was the first to react, firing a volley of buckshot into Davis's chest.

Sheriff Coffey led a group of officers armed with Thompson submachine guns toward the cabins where the suspects were suspected of hiding at 11 p.m.\n\nBarrow's .30 caliber BAR, stolen on July 7 from the National Guard armory in Enid, Oklahoma, was no match for the.45 caliber Thompsons. After a bullet short-circuited the armored car's horn, which police officers mistook for a cease-fire signal, the gang escaped. Officers did not pursue Barrow and Clyde's getaway car."

It would appear, to some, that this announcement is the firebrand to start the whole inferno.\n\nIn a full national radio address, crisscrossing the wires during primetime last night, Senator Long introduced his ‘Share Our Wealth’ plan, an intricate program designed to raise the national standard of living for all citizens. By capping personal fortunes at $50 million dollars, restructuring the federal tax code into a progressive hierarchy and limiting annual income to $1 million dollars a year, Long promoted a vision of an America for the people and not just the top hands of society. While the newspapers, owned by those who would be directly impacted by these cuts, lambasted Long as a communist buffoon, the common folks are roaring with approval and jubilation.\n\nTie all that in with public works spending, free higher education and veteran and old-age pensions, Long has effectively just propelled himself to the 36’ democratic nomination in an instant.

Roosevelt's star continued to rise while Smith's did not, culminating in the triumph of his progressive wing over Smith and the party's conservatives in the 1932 and 1936 primaries.\n\nMany see Smith's defection as a sign that the conservative wing of the Democratic Party is losing patience with Roosevelt and the New Deal but find themselves powerless to combat the progressives within their own organization.

The infamous and bloodiest battle of the Civil War, the Battle of Gettysburg, marks its 75th anniversary today, with 2500 veterans from North and South coming together to remember America’s own Armageddon. Old grey and blue civil war soldiers shook hands across the historic battle line and raised their hats in respect for one another. It has been only 25 years since the 50th anniversary of Gettysburg, where 50,000 veterans were able to return to the battle site. As time passes, the last survivors of America’s deadliest war will pass on, and we will be the ones to pass on their stories. For this anniversary, veterans were able to see the dedication of a new peace monument by President [Root.GetLeader]. As the American flag draped over the monument was pulled down, a flame ignited from the top, and the large crowd clapped and cheered for the commemoration."

This comes from a speech he made at the unveiling of a new plaque honoring Franco-American relations. During his commemoration speech, Bullitt stated, “France and the United States were united in war and peace.” The press quickly assumed that this meant America was willing to defend France if necessary, and before he was corrected, the papers were already published. However, the president has now clarified the situation, saying he was “110% wrong.”\n\nDue to the high tensions on the European continent, newspaper reporters have now withdrawn the stories speculating Bullitts phasing."

 USA_Flavor.36.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]A hurricane made landfall in New England yesterday, quickly becoming one of the most unusual and destructive weather events in recent years. The hurricane, whose existence was unknown until it crossed into the Caribbean, is thought to have formed as a tropical storm off the coast of West Africa. The hurricane, which peaked at 160 mph as it passed over the Bahamas, would settle into wind speeds of 120-129 mph as it plowed through Long Island on its way to New England. There have been comparisons to the Great Colonial Hurricane of 1635, the only known hurricane to have hit the region so hard.\n\nOver 57,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed thus far, with total property losses predicted to be around $300 million. According to current estimates, the death toll is well over 600. Attempts to send aid into the region have been hampered by infrastructure damage caused by flooding and falling trees. The New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad, which runs from New Haven to Providence, was particularly hard hit, with countless bridges along the Shore Line destroyed or flooded, cutting rail connections to hard-hit towns like Westerly, Rhode Island.\n\nAs it stands, the hurricane is expected to become an extratropical cyclone and dissipate as it moves into Canada over the next few days."

 USA_Flavor.37.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Yesterday, CBS aired their radio adaptation of 'The War of the Worlds' by H.G.Welles. The book it was based on is about creatures from Mars who are technologically superior to us invading Earth. The broadcast was directed and narrated by Orson Welles. It started with an announcement that this was an adaption of the book and Orson reading the prologue that was a little different from the book. Next, the broadcast turned into ”evening broadcasts” that was interrupted by strange explosions from Mars and a report of an unidentifiable object on a farm in New Jersey.\n\nWhat follows next are news broadcasts announcing an alien invasion from Mars. Apparently, the magnificent voice acting and the amount of realism in the fake new broadcasts caused some people to think an actual invasion was occurring. Another potential factor is that some viewers tuned in later and didn't hear the first announcement. Producer John Houseman found out that CBS supervisor Davidson Taylor received a call where he had been ordered to tell the audience during the show that the broadcasts were fake and part of the show."

The event, which garnered an audience of over 20,000 people, was also attended by a crowd of nearly 100,000 anti-Nazi demonstrators who gathered around the arena in protest of the Bund.\n\nMayor of New York City, Fiorello La Guardia, dispatched the highest number of police to a single event yet seen in the city’s history, with nearly 1,700 uniformed police officers patrolling outside the venue, along with 600 undercover detectives and non-uniformed police officers scattered throughout the hall, and even 35 firefighters armed with a heavy-duty fire hose in preparation of a riot.\n\nBeginning at 8pm, the event began with a rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner”, sung by Margarete Rittershaush, and a speech by James Wheeler-Hill, national secretary of the Bund, opening with the statement that “If George Washington were alive today, he would be friends with Adolf Hitler.” Midwestern Gau leader George Froboese was next to speak and pushed the idea of “Jewish world domination.” Next up was West Coast leader Hermann Schwinn, who ferociously denounced Jewish control of Hollywood and news industries.\n\nFinally, Bundersfuhrer Fritz Kuhn took to the stage, also deciding to push the anti-Semitic theme, going as far as to refer to the President as a “Judeo-Capitalist cretin”, as well as Fiorello “Jew Lumpen” La Guardia himself. All came to an abrupt standstill however, as in the middle of Kuhn’s final speech, one Isadore Greenbaum broke through the lines of OD men and charged at the speaker on the stage. Quickly swarmed by Ordnungsdienst, the man was violently dealt with, before Kuhn delivered his rousing finish to thunderous cheers and chants of “Free America!”"

He last played Sunday in New York against the Washington Senators.\n\nWhen Gehrig will start another game is undetermined.

The film, based on a 1936 novel of the same name by Margaret Mitchell, is set against the backdrop of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction era. The film tells the story of Scarlett O'Hara, the strong-willed daughter of a Georgia plantation owner, following her romantic pursuit of Ashley Wilkes, who is married to his cousin, Melanie Hamilton, and her subsequent marriage to Rhett Butler.\n\nThe film has been faced with a famously troubled production, being forced to delay filming for two years until January 1939 because of Selznick's determination to secure Gable for the role of Rhett. Simultaneously, the role of Scarlett was difficult to cast, with 1,400 unknown women auditioning for the part. The original screenplay by Sidney Howard also underwent many revisions by several writers in order to reduce it to a suitable length. Post-production concluded in November 1939, just a month before its release.\n\nThough criticized for its long length, the film clocking in at over 3 and half hours, their troubles seem to have paid off.

The fire quickly lit the Spanish Moss hanging over the rafters as decoration and engulfed the building in a matter of minutes.

The band present at the time was also credited with trying to calm the crowd with music, but only two members are suspected to have made it out alive. By the time firehoses started spraying the building, the hot metal created steam so hot it burned the skin of the people inside. When the fire was extinguished fifteen minutes later, rescue workers found a pile of bodies in the back of the dancehall almost at shoulder height, most victims likely dying from smoke inhalation and trampling.

The Soviet Union is encircling half of Europe, and President Truman is determined to stop the spread of communism around the world. Therefore, Truman has declared that it is necessary for our country and its allies to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or outside pressure to ensure that assisting citizens of many nations across the world can work out their own destinies in their own way. We will be able to achieve this goal by providing economic and financial assistance, which is critical to stability and an orderly political processes."

Although it is simple to take an eye for an eye, we must still be a just force for the order of the world in the future, so a trial is necessary. Besides showing to the world that we can act within the rule of law and fairness, we must also take some reservation in our approach, as not everyone within the imperial cabinet deserves to die, as some are too useful for us to dispose of.

 USA_Japanese_Leaders_Trial.2.d: "Now that the war against the Japanese has come to an end, leaders and senior officials of the Army, Navy and Airforce, as well as occupation administrators now have their fate placed within the hands of US forces. Four years since Pearl Harbor has gone by quickly and the Americans have not forgotten the pain it has brought them, and along with the heavy losses in the Pacific War, the nation has been hurt and there is much personal grief. Because of this, the USA have decided to take serious action, and execute everyone with significant ranks within the Imperial Administration, with only those who have relation to the royal family escaping the bullets. It is not a pretty sight to be seen on the international stage, but it is hard to say that these actions are not justified considering what the Japanese leaders have done."

 USA_Japanese_Leaders_Trial.3.t: "The Trial of Kenji Doihara"
 USA_Japanese_Leaders_Trial.3.d: "Kenji Doihara was a war criminal, officer, and general in Japan. As a senior intelligence officer, he was instrumental in the Japanese plots that resulted in the occupation of large parts of China, the destabilization of the country, and the disintegration of the traditional structure of Chinese society in order to reduce reaction to the Japanese plans by employing highly unconventional methods. He became the mastermind of the Manchurian drug trade, as well as the true boss and sponsor of all gang and underworld activity in China.\n\nDoihara was convicted on counts 1, 27, 29, 31, 32, 35, 36, 54, and 55 for his brutal treatment of POWs and internees, as well as his involvement in the Manchurian narcotics trade. He was sentenced to death and will be hanged at Sugamo Prison on December 23, 1948."

 USA_Japanese_Leaders_Trial.4.d: "Over the past few days, the trial for war criminal Koki Hirota has taken place, who was the Prime Minister of the Japanese Empire from 1936 to 1937.\n\nBefore becoming Prime Minister, he was the foreign minister in 1935, and negotiated the purchase of the Chinese Eastern Railway in Manchuria from Russian interests. He also promulgated the Hirota Sangensoku (The Three Principles by Hirota), with the three principles being the establishment of a Japan–China–Manchukuo bloc, the organization of a Sino-Japanese common front against the spread of communism, and the suppression of anti-Japanese activities within China.\n\nDuring his time in office as Prime Minister, Hirota signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with the German Reich and the Kingdom of Italy, before resigning after disagreements with the Army. After being appointed foreign minister, Japanese forces marched on the Chinese capital of Nanking, with brutal acts of massacre and rape took place during the fighting. Estimates are that in six weeks, Japanese forces murdered around 300,000 and raped nearly 20,000 women, who were later killed or mutilated. Most of them were thrown into the Yangtze River and used for bayonet charges, others buried alive. Koki Hirota oversaw these inhuman acts, and while he insists he did not have the power to stop to the units from doing this, he is just as evil as the rest of them. The judges have found him guilty of three charges:\n\nCount 1: As leaders, organizers, instigators, or accomplices in the formulation or execution of a common plan or conspiracy to wage wars of aggression, and war or wars in violation of international law.\n\nCount 27: Waging unprovoked war against China.\n\nCount 55: Deliberately and recklessly disregarded their duty to take adequate steps to prevent atrocities.\n\nWith this decision, he has been sentenced to execution by hanging, making sure that one less war criminal walks on this planet."

It was responsible for some of the most notorious war crimes which were committed by the armed forces of Imperial Japan. Unit 731 was based in the Pingfang district of Harbin, the largest city in the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo, and had active branch offices throughout China and Southeast Asia.\n\nBecause Unit 731 is not an actual person, the sentences were not the same for everybody. Most of the people involved in the group received terms of 20 to 25 years. But there were individuals who only got 2 or 3 years. However, we must decide if we should give immunity to valuable physics scientists and leaders, as they could be very helpful in the development of new technologies to combat future threats. If we do this, we must not announce it to the public as it could provoke a bad response from the Soviet Union. "

He was the commander in chief until April 7, 1945, when his troops were forced to surrender. Itagaki took part in both the Allied War escalation and the Imperial Japanese occupation of Manchuria.\n\nDuring his time as the commander of Japanese forces in Southeast Asia, he frequently permitted inhumane treatment of POWs.

Some of these horrors included human experimentation programmes. The results of experiments aimed at testing human resistance to viruses, epidemics, or radiation are horrifying to see or even read.\n\nThe results of these experiments, which were partially funded and supplied by Tojo's government and his associates, were condemned by the Allies immediately after their discovery and are now being dismantled by joint Chinese and American forces in the region.\n\nA macabre discovery, however, has been made: the list of those responsible. Members of the Imperial Japanese Family have also been found on this list. Naruhiko, Prince Higashikuni; Yasuhito, Prince Chichibu; Takahito, Prince Mikasa; and Tsuneyoshi, Prince Takeda are among them. They are all involved in these crimes, in some way.

Naruhiko, Prince Higashikuni; Yasuhito, Prince Chichibu; Takahito, Prince Mikasa; and Tsuneyoshi, Prince Takeda were the accused.\n\nFirst, due to their lack of knowledge about the situation, Princes Naruhiko and Tsuneyoshi were sentenced to prison, which was later commuted to house arrest, in this case inside the royal palace in Tokyo.\n\nSecond, Prince Takahito, who was accused of knowing about the events but not being directly involved, was sentenced to ten years in prison with no possibility of commutation.\n\nFinally, Prince Yasuhito, who is accused of directly participating in some of the experiences. Despite his arguments that he has tuberculosis and thus should suffer no further harm from this war, the Emperor's Showa oldest brother was sentenced to death, and he now awaits his execution by hanging, which is expected after the trial concludes."

Even the imperial family had been accused of involvement, but despite their presence, one figure was conspicuously absent throughout the trial: Emperor Showa Hirohito.\n\nFor some, such as Shumei Okawa, the charges were dropped after our doctors determined that he was mentally unfit to stand trial. Yosuke Matsuoka and Osami Nagano died of natural causes during the trial, and their charges were also dropped.\n\nSentences have been handed down on either side. Six people have been sentenced to death for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and crimes against peace. They will be hanged once the trials are completed. Iwane Matsui, one of the defendants, was also sentenced to death for war crimes and crimes against humanity. He will also be hanged once the trials are completed.\n\nFinally, six defendants will spend the rest of their lives in prison due to their lack of involvement or knowledge of the situation during the operations.\n\nThose sentenced to death will be executed soon at Sugamo Prison.

A few articles have been written, and among them, Japan accepts all of those verdicts, as well as full support and provision of buildings for prison sentences and executions.\n\nSome argue that the government accepts suppressing the rights to grant clemency, reduce sentences, or even grant parole to those prisoners because of their crimes against humanity, thereby "taking away their right to humanity," as stated by an American representative.\n\nAs the trials come to an end, so does this bloody and painful chapter in Asia's history, and the region's future is irreversibly altered as a result."

They’ve recently offered us fighter planes in support of the Royal Airforce, as a gesture of cooperation between us. However, there is a catch: we will have to pay upfront for the fighters and deliver them ourselves. It could be a bit costly at the moment, but ready-to-go planes are a much better investment than rushing new ones through production lines. What should we tell them?"

Although affordable and much needed on their end, they decided that their money and merchant ships would be better used elsewhere. It’s not too big of a deal, but if the deal had gone through, it would’ve been a great boost for the economy and the aviation industry. Oh well, it’s their choice if they want planes to defend their island, not ours. Plus, we get to hang onto our fighters for other cooperating business partners. "
 USA_Cash_and_Carry.2.A: "We were only trying to help, after all."

 USA_Cash_and_Carry.3.t: "Britain Accepts!"
 USA_Cash_and_Carry.3.d: "Great Britain, perpetually in need of new fighters as the air war intensifies over Europe, has accepted our offer of over 200. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the Cash and Carry policy, we cannot allow the planes to be flown to Britain from US soil. Cash and Carry is the policy that allows the sale of war materiel to belligerents, as long as the recipients arrange for the transport using their own ships and pay immediately in cash.\n\nIn theory, this policy continues forwards our larger policy of neutrality on the current conflict over in Europe, as all sides are treated equally in terms of trading war materials. In practice, the policy was designed intentionally so as to advantage the allies, who were most likely to be able to control sea lanes and send ships to pick up products. In this instance however, it means that getting these fighters to England will take a little longer than expected. Fortunately, we share one of the longest borders on Earth with a nation that can send those fighters to Great Britain."

They are doing this to aid in the defence of democracy around the world against the massive threat posed by authoritarian powers.\n\nArmed assistance from the United States would undoubtedly be of great help to us, as weapon production could be hampered at any time during the war by enemy attacks. It would also enable us to get closer to them and strengthen ties between our two countries.\n\nAlternatively, we could decline their assistance in order to prevent American influence from spreading too far after the war. When we win, they may claim that they were the ones who kept us afloat, implying that they played a larger role than they actually did.\n\nSo, what should we do?

Their refusal means that they could struggle to ensure that their forces have enough weapons, which could severely affect their combat efficiency. It also means that we will not be able to properly show ourselves as a force for the protection of democracy around the world.\n\nHowever, if that is their choice, we must abide by it, and perhaps send these weapons to other nations that are more likely to accept them."

Their acceptance has enabled us to export our weapons, allowing us to profit from them and possibly reap some post-war benefits when they begin rebuilding, as we will be regarded as a reliable partner.\n\nWith our help, they will surely be able to put up a better fight against their adversaries."

 USA_Department_of_War.1.d: "Philip Turner's job is straightforward. He spends the entire day standing in front of a gauge, and when it reaches a hundred, he opens a valve to release the pressure in the pipe. When all of the pressure has been released, he tightens the valve again and repeats the process. He does have to wear special shielding to do the work, but the pay is good and the work is simple. Philip is unsure of the purpose of his work. He is not required to understand.\n\nIn reality, Philip is enriching uranium for a project at Los Alamos National Laboratory in the American West. The project, officially codenamed Development of Substitute Materials, was authorised earlier this year by President Roosevelt to pursue two lines of development exploring the potential explosive capabilities of uranium and the recently discovered plutonium. It is also in charge of gathering information on the German nuclear energy project.\n\nCertain voices in the scientific community have been debating the feasibility of such a uranium bomb for several years. It has been suggested that a bomb of this type could harness the explosive power of thousands of tonnes of TNT. As of now, the project's ability to produce any significant results is unknown. Much of the money is currently being spent on just building the facilities needed to enrich uranium to the level required for research.

We almost certainly can, thanks to the strength of 132 million willing Americans at home and one of the world's largest economies. However, in order for our military to be capable of handling a large-scale war like the current one on two fronts, it will need to become significantly more organised.\n\nThe British Chiefs of Staff Committee has long provided effective administrative, tactical, and strategic direction to British forces throughout their global empire. A system like this enables each branch of the military to effectively coordinate with one another and determine the broad strategic strokes required to win the war or achieve any other goal set before it.\n\nOurs will be structured similarly. The Joint Chiefs of Staff will be the supreme military body in the United States for strategic direction. This joint committee will have four members: one from the army, one from the navy, one from the army air corps, and a special military advisor to the military who will also serve as Chief of Staff to the Commanders in Chief of the Army and Navy."

All the planes and men in the world are useless if you do not know when and where to deploy them. Unfortunately, in that regard, the US has fallen behind. Other agencies, like those of MI6 or the Abwehr have given their respective countries valuable information that has advanced their respective war efforts.\n\nTo that end, the US will be establishing its own intelligence agency, the Office of Strategic Services. The OSS will be tasked with providing a worldwide overview of the German war effort, its strengths and weaknesses, as well as assisting the military with any covert operations that need to be done. Such operations will include performing acts of sabotage, waging propaganda war, organizing and coordinating resistance groups, and providing military training for guerrilla movements, among other things.\n\nThough still nascent, our allies’ intelligence agencies will help us develop our organization’s connections globally, in addition to our existing ties to rebel groups and opposing forces in Europe and Asia. With our major OSS training site, codenamed Shangri-La, already built and operational, it is only a matter of time before OSS agents start seeing deployment in the field."

A unified department in charge of the military branches of services must be established if we want to prevent another Pearl Harbor from happening again, so our lack of preparedness and coordination between services must be addressed. Adding on to this change, we should also grant more independence for our air force by giving them their own department so resource allocation and management within the defense department can be better streamlined to reach a more effective result.

Quezon and Sergio Osmea were declared the winners, taking the positions of president and vice president, respectively.\n\nAgainst his two main opponents, Emilio Aguinaldo and Gregorio Aglipay, Quezon received nearly 68% of the vote. Quezon will be inaugurated as the Philippines' second President.\n\nUnder the Reorganization Act, President Quezon was given the authority to appoint the Philippines' first all-Filipino cabinet. Since 1901, a Filipino has always been appointed chief justice, but the majority of Supreme Court members were Americans. Complete Filipinization has now been achieved with the establishment of the Commonwealth of the Philippines.\n\nTo meet the demands of the newly established government structure, as well as to comply with the provisions of the Tydings-McDuffie Act and the requirements of the Constitution, President Quezon, true to his pledge of "More Government and Less Politics," has initiated a reorganization of government bodies."

 USA_Philippines.5.d: "Today marks the end of the Commonwealth of the Philippines and the recognition of Philippine independence by the United States, as stipulated by the Tyding-McDuffie Act and Article XVIII of the 1935 Constitution. The President issued Proclamation 2695, officially recognizing the Philippines' independence, in accordance with the Tydings-McDuffie Act.\n\nThe Treaty of Manila, formally the Treaty of General Relations and Protocol, a treaty of general relations, was also signed on this day in Manila, the capital of the Philippines. It abdicates US sovereignty over the Philippines and recognizes the Republic of the Philippines' independence. The treaty was signed by High Commissioner Paul V. McNutt as the United States' representative and President Manuel Roxas as the Philippines' representative."

 USA_Philippines.6.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]The Commonwealth of the Philippines ends today, and the Republic of the Philippines begins. The United States has officially abdicated sovereignty over the Philippines and recognized Philippine independence under the Tydings-McDuffie Act.\n\nFormer Philippine President Manuel Quezon, who worked tirelessly for the country's independence and is one of the main reasons why the Philippines have gained independence today, has been celebrated all over the country, and even though he will never see his dream come true, his words still resound in every Filipino:\n\n\"My fellow citizens, there is one thing I want you to remember always. And it is: you are Filipinos. That the Philippines are your home and the only home God has given you. That you must keep it for yourself, your children, and your children's children until the end of the world. You must live for it, and if necessary, die for it.\n\nYour country is wonderful. It has a fantastic past and a fantastic future. Yesterday's Philippines were consecrated by the sacrifices of lives and treasure made by your patriots, martyrs, and soldiers. The Philippines of today are honored by unselfish and courageous statesmen's wholehearted devotion to its cause. Tomorrow's Philippines will be a land of plenty, happiness, and liberty. A Philippines with her head held high in the midst of the West Pacific, mistress of her own destiny, holding the torch of freedom and democracy in her hand.

 USA_Philippines.7.d: ""After my efforts to gain independence for our country failed, I listened to several American politicians warn our people against independence, arguing that under the American flag, you are not denied any individual liberty. No one has surpassed me in recognizing the United States' government and people for their efforts in the Philippines. But no one can say in my presence that our people had more freedom under the American administration, or that our people will not have as much freedom under an independent Philippines as they did under the American flag.\n\nI once said, and I'm proud of it, "I'd rather have a government run like hell by Filipinos than a government run like heaven by Americans." I would rather have a government run by Filipinos like hell than a government run by any foreigner like heaven. I said it once, I'll say it again, and I'll keep saying it as long as I live.""
 USA_Philippines.7.A: "Just another rabble-rouser"

 USA_Philippines.8.t: "Stirrings in Manila"
 USA_Philippines.8.d: ""For over 30 years, we have been governed by Americans. But when did the common tao receive government protection? You may have heard American governors-general accuse the cacique of abusing his power, but they were only criticizing political bosses, not economic bosses, whom they never pursued. When was the last time Juan de la Cruz had a chance at social justice? Under American rule, a law in this country allowed for the imprisonment of a kasama who left his landlord while remaining peculiarly obligated to the latter. Is that liberty? Is that the freedom you so proudly claim the Filipinos have under the current regime—allowing a poor tao who owes his landlord to be imprisoned?\n\nWill you have less faith in your own people, in a man of your own flesh and blood, I wonder? Will you place less trust in him than you would in a foreign governor-general? When and by whom was the right to habeas corpus in the Philippines denied? It was denied during the first years of American occupation, if you remember the Batangas concentration camps. Did the Philippine government, while purely in American hands, ever consider the Filipino and his existence to be its primary concern? When did you have a bank organized to promote Filipino commercial interests? When did you have a bank, the Philippine National Bank, organized to help Filipino farmers, Filipino industrialists?\n\nPoliticians in the United States have denied us our right to freedom and independence. They have taken away our right to prosper and grow, as well as our right to make our own decisions and form our own government. I believe that if they do not give us our freedom by choice, we will have to take it for ourselves.""

 USA_Philippines.9.t: "The Sakdalistas Denounce Us!"
 USA_Philippines.9.d: "Benigno Ramos, a writer, founded the Sakdalista movement in 1930. The name of the movement is derived from the Tagalog word "Sakdal", which means "to accuse". The platform of the movement is centered on immediate independence, estate redistribution, tax reductions, and increased governmental transparency. It is estimated that the movement has 20,000 formal members who influence hundreds of thousands of Filipinos.\n\nThe movement has chapters all over the Philippines, and the Sakdalistas made an incredible showing in the House of Representatives, winning all the seats that they ran for. A Sakdalista was appointed governor of the province of Marinduque. Furthermore, the party's municipal candidates in Laguna, Bulacan, Rizal, and Cavite made outstanding gains and won a slew of important positions. These numerous victories, combined with our refusal to recognize Philippine independence, are certainly strong enough to truly challenge the Nacionalistas and other parties, and the Sakdalista movement has been thrust into the spotlight, demonstrating the depth of discontent in the Philippines.\n\nThe Sakdalistas have officially condemned us and promised that the Philippines will have complete and absolute independence regardless of whether we allow it or not."

 USA_Philippines.9.A.tt: "§RThe situation in the Philippines is beginning to get out of hand...§!"

 USA_Philippines.10.t: "In the Port of Manila"
 USA_Philippines.10.d: "Manuel Quezon had fallen short. He was unable to persuade the US Congress that granting the Philippines independence is the only way to peace and prosperity. The Sakdalistas are currently arming themselves in preparation for a second Philippine-American War. Despite his regret that no peaceful solution was found, he places his hopes and prayers with the proud Filipinos fighting for their homeland.\n\nHe and many of his party members are no longer able to stay here. Recent bans and splintering of pro-independence groups in the United States have forced them to flee the country and live in exile. They are not in fighting shape, and Quezon is no longer the soldier he was ten years ago.\n\nThey will travel to Japan with the hope of one day returning to a prosperous and proud Philippines free of foreign oppression and ruled by Filipinos."
 USA_Philippines.10.A: "We shall return"

 USA_Philippines.11.t: "The Philippine Islands Territory"
 USA_Philippines.11.d: "In response to the high risk of insurgency and armed conflict with Filipinos, as well as the dangerous Sakdalista movement, which is growing in popularity by the day, the Philippines have been officially declared a territory of the United States, effective immediately.\n\nMore American forces are en route to the Philippines to continue to secure and extend our control over the islands and interior mountainous areas that have proven particularly resistant to our occupation, while also attempting to suppress an armed insurgency.\n\nFurther preparations are already being made to recognize the Philippines as an official state of the United States sometime in the far future, but until then we cannot afford to lose control of the islands."
 USA_Philippines.11.A: "Yesterday insular, today a territorial, tomorrow a state?"

 USA_Philippines.12.t: "Action"
 USA_Philippines.12.d: "Oliver despised the Philippines. As far as the eye can see, there are forests and mountains. For weeks, he and his squad have been patrolling smaller villages and suspected Sakdalista hotspots. He didn't expect to be sent to a backwater island like this when he enlisted. The people at the top are apparently afraid of a revolt or armed insurgency, but aside from some angry looks and what sounded like swear words from some of the locals, he saw nothing that suggested armed hostility.\n\nSome shouting disrupted the normally very quiet landscape as they took a break in a small forest clearing near a small village. They dashed into the forest, between the trees where the shouting was coming from.\n\nBefore they realized what was going on, Oliver and his entire squad were staring down the barrel of several rifles held by a group of Sakdalistas."
 USA_Philippines.12.A: "And with a bang - Blackness"

 USA_Philippines.13.t: "The Sakdalista Proclamation"
 USA_Philippines.13.d: "The worst-case scenario occurred. Due to our failures in suppressing the Sakdalista movement and reinforcing our control of the islands, the Sakdalistas have officially declared an independent Philippines, the Second Philippine Republic, free of American occupation, with Benigno Ramos as its leader.\n\nIn the same breath, they have declared war on the United States in the name of freedom and independence, stating that they will not stop fighting until all American forces have been withdrawn from the Philippines and we have officially recognized the Second Philippine Republic's sovereignty and independence.\n\nIt is time to take up arms against the Filipinos and demonstrate the might of the United States armed forces once more. The Second Philippine-American War will end in the same way that the first did: with a total American victory."
 USA_Philippines.13.A: "Not again..."

 USA_Philippines.14.t: "The Second Philippine-American War"
 USA_Philippines.14.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Following the United States' refusal to grant the Philippines independence, the Sakdalista movement has amassed a large following in recent months and years. The Sakdalista movement was founded by writer Benigno Ramos, and its platform focuses on immediate independence, estate redistribution, taxation reductions, and increased governmental transparency.\n\nToday, the Sakdalistas declared an independent Philippines, the Second Philippine Republic, free of American occupation, led by Benigno Ramos. At the same time, they have declared war on the United States until all American troops currently stationed in the Philippines are recalled and the United States government recognizes the Second Philippine Republic's independence and sovereignty.\n\nThis marks the beginning of the Second Philippine-American war, with the first ending in an American victory. It remains to be seen whether the Philippines will be able to maintain their independence or whether the Sakdalista movement will be crushed under the American boot."

 USA_Philippines.14.B: "So much for "self-determination" it seems..."

 USA_Philippines.15.t: "Congress Demands an End to War"
 USA_Philippines.15.d: "This war has been plagued by failure after failure. What appeared to be a simple and quick victory has dragged on for months and months. The general public at home is becoming restless, wondering why and for what we are sending our soldiers to die. We still don't have control of Manila, and without it, we have no chance of winning this war any time soon.\n\nCongress has made a decision and issued an ultimatum to the President. They demand that we immediately end the war and make peace with the Sakdalista movement, lest things at home spiral out of control even further. We appear to have no choice but to withdraw our troops from the Philippines and begin negotiating a peace treaty with the Sakdalistas.\n\nToday is a tragic day for our country because we have not only lost our largest holding in Asia, but we have also gained a potential future adversary if the Filipinos choose to ally with the Japanese."

Filipinos can finally rest easy, knowing that the terrorists who threaten their peaceful way of life have been defeated.\n\nWe clearly gave the Philippines far too much autonomy, and we will not repeat that error. General Douglas MacArthur will take over as President of the Philippines and form a temporary military government until things calm down and tensions subside.\n\nThe Philippines are back under our complete control, and while this is cause for celebration, it is a shame and failure on our part that it could have even escalated this far."

As they approached Hiroshima, Watanabi and his pilot could see that most of the city had been reduced to rubble, and flames had engulfed most of whatever was remaining.\n\nWatanabe could feel a lump in his throat as he stared at the destruction. He felt his breathing slow down nearly to a halt.

### New Deal
 USA_New_Deal_Category: "The New Deal"
 USA_New_Deal_Category_desc: "\n\n\n£decision_header_USA_WPA£\n\n\n\nThe WPA, or the Works Progress Administration is a government agency formed as part of President Roosevelt’s New Deal program. This agency intends to help relieve the effects of the Great Depression by employing and putting to work the millions of unskilled laborers and workers who are currently experiencing poverty and hardship throughout the country. The public works projects that they will work on will not only provide them with a satisfactory income that they can live on but revitalise the ageing and inadequate infrastructure that our nation currently possesses."

 USA_The_First_100_Days: "The First 100 Days"
 USA_The_First_100_Days_desc: "As the Great Depression persists, the state of the economy and our country worsens, but with our new president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, hopefully, things will start to change for the better. To kickstart the president’s ambitious plans for the country, he intends to use his first 100 days in office to pass new initiatives that will hopefully counter the effects of this crisis and generate some political momentum that will last for the next four years.\n\nIf however, the president doesn’t enact programs that combat the most pressing issues in the country, his presidency will be off to a rocky start that will have some serious consequences on his ability to put forward and ratify his bold agenda for the future."

 USA_Public_Works_in_the_Northeast: "Public Works in the Northeast"
 USA_Public_Works_in_the_Northeast_desc: "Even though the Northeast hasn't been hit as hard by the Depression as the South or Midwest, mainly due to its more urban character opposed to an industrial or agricultural one, economical instability still has managed to drive thousands of businesses into bankruptcy and millions of workers into unemployment alongside them. To improve the situation in the birthplace of the United States, the WPA will have to be expanded even further, to provide jobs to increasingly restless masses."
 USA_Public_Works_in_the_Midwest: "Public Works in the Midwest"
 USA_Public_Works_in_the_Midwest_desc: "The Midwest was the leading region in both industry and farming, but now with the Great Depression in full swing, the region is on the verge of collapse. Most of the industrial workers are unable to maintain their families and the farmers from the SW corner are desperate left without either home or food because of the Dust Bowl.\nWe should be quick to expand the WPA into the region as a way to maintain the people until either the farming can be started again or the Great Depression recedes."

 USA_Public_Works_in_the_South_desc: "The American South has never been a rich region and now with the Great Depression in full swing, the state is plagued by poverty and unemployment on a scale never seen before, with farms closing down left and right, factories going out of business and thousands being left homeless, hungry and jobless.\nIt should be our number one priority to expand the WPA to the South to once again revitalize the region by providing jobs, new infrastructure and a way out of the poverty gripping the Southern States"

 USA_Public_Works_in_the_West_desc: "While most of the western regions have fared better than others during the depression, expanding the WPA to states like California, Washington, Oregon and Nevada must be a priority for this administration. Major infrastructure projects like dams, reservoirs and irrigation programs can be built to bolster farmlands and provide rural electricity to farmers in the Rockies. Moreover, public works such as national parks and forests could be created to preserve the natural beauty and wonder of the American West."

 Herbert_Hoover_desc: "Businessman, politician, and humanitarian, if these words were used to describe an American it would be Herbert Clerk Hoover.\n\nWhen Hoover graduated from Stanford University in 1895, he was hired by Bewick, Moreing & Co., a London-based company, to help operate gold mines in Western Australia. In 1908, he left Bewick, Moreing to become an independent London-based mining consultant and financier. He co-founded the Zinc Corporation to extract zinc near Broken Hill, Australia and helped increase copper production in Kyshtym, Russia. By 1914, He had amassed an impressive fortune. After the outbreak of the Great War, Hoover became the head of the Commission for Relief in Belgium, a relief organization that provided food to occupied Belgium until the U.S. entered the war. In 1917, President Woodrow Wilson appointed Hoover to head the Food Administration, and Hoover became known as America's "Food Czar". After the war, Hoover led the American Relief Administration to provide food for the inhabitants of newly formed nations in Central and Eastern Europe. After the 1920 election, President Warren G. Harding appointed Hoover as Secretary of Commerce. Soon Hoover became influential in the development of radio and air travel and he led the federal response to the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, which had earned him wide acclaim for his role in the crisis. \n\nDue to his popularity, Hoover easily won the presidency in 1928. He opposed government intervention on the economy because he thought they infringed upon American ideals of individual freedom and self-reliance. After a few years, Hoover's approval rating has gone down the toilet as he was incapable of creating policies to address issues plaguing the nation, like the Wall Street Crash and Prohibition. Due to this, he lost in the recent election to a Democratic candidate, Franklin D. Roosevelt. Hoover's disastrous presidency severely damaged the image and popularity of the Republican Party."
 Harry_S_Truman_desc: ""If we see that Germany is winning we ought to help Russia, and if Russia is winning we ought to help Germany, and that way let them kill as many as possible although I don't want to see Hitler victorious under any circumstances."\n\nHarry S. Truman grew up in Missouri and served as a captain in the Field Artillery during World War I. When he returned home, he opened a haberdashery in Kansas City, Missouri, and was elected as a Jackson County judge in 1922. In 1934, Truman was elected to the United States Senate from Missouri.\n\nFrom 1940 to 1944, he rose to national prominence as the chairman of the Truman Committee, which sought to reduce waste and inefficiency in wartime contracts. Truman visited several military bases in 1940. He used his chairmanship of the Committee on Military Affairs Subcommittee on War Mobilization to launch investigations into abuses while the country was preparing for war. Truman appointed a new special committee to conduct a formal investigation. Truman led the committee with extraordinary skill and usually achieved consensus, resulting in widespread media coverage that earned him a national reputation."

Bank runs, sudden demands by large numbers of customers to withdraw all their funds at almost the same time, brought down many banking corporations as depositors attempted to withdraw more money than the bank had available. In order to win back the public’s trust and to encourage them to deposit their money, the Federal government will be creating the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

 USA_Deregulated_Insurance_Industry_Idea_desc: "Until the middle of the nineteenth century, insurance in the United States was largely unregulated. New Hampshire was the first state to appoint an insurance commissioner in 1850. Shortly after that, other states followed until nearly every state had "some type of supervision and control over insurance companies. The legislation and rules promulgated by insurance commissions in one state frequently clashed with those of other states. Furthermore, the rules that applied to out-of-state insurers in some cases deprived them of significant rights. The Supreme Court has consistently rejected insurers' attempts to avoid state regulation on this basis for over 75 years. Since the McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945, insurance companies have been exempt from most federal regulations."

It remains to be seen if this cooperation and compromise will last or if it is destined to fail."

There will be no more wasteful and crippling taxation for our people. This is only the first in a series of tax reforms proposed by Landon, but it is critical.

At the age of 12, children are permitted to work for an unlimited number of hours before and after school. While this was already true for agricultural labor, it is now also true for all other industries and economic sectors.

The organization became involved behind the scenes in a major coal industry strike in 1902, attempting to bring coal operators and unionized miners together to forge a solution to the work stoppage. The National Civic Federation has been instrumental in expanding and assisting in the creation of uniform state laws concerning child labor, workers' compensation, and factory safety. They had been plagued by financial difficulties since their relationship with the labor movement had largely ended, and business leaders had also withdrew their financial support. The President has decided to provide them with government assistance lest they go bankrupt and cease operations."

The effects of this crisis are being felt all over the nation, but a step towards recovery has been taken. It is known as the ‘New Deal’ - President Roosevelt's ambitious plan to counteract the Depression and restore the economic strength of the Roaring Twenties. This shuffle of the economic deck will be one of the most radical changes in direction that the country has undertaken, and there will be no guarantee of success, but at least the average American will be able to sleep at night knowing that their government is fighting for them and their future."

The new president has promised a ”New Deal,” for the American people, a series of reforms that if implemented correctly, could prove to be the miracle that many across the country have prayed for. Whether Roosevelt is the magician who can solve America's problems is yet to be seen, but a strong start in these "first one hundred days" will be crucial if he is to gather the momentum needed to pursue some of his more radical ideas in the future, and turn around this country in shambles."

President Roosevelt, favors his predecessor's non-interventionist policies, in an effort to denounce past U.S. interventionism and subdue any subsequent fears of Latin Americans, the president has announced during his inaugural address, to dedicate the nation to the policy of ”The Good Neighbor”, the neighbor who respects himself and respects the rights of others, the neighbor who respects his obligations and respects the sanctity of his agreements in and with a World of neighbors. This policy aims for friendly relationships between the United States and Central as well as South American countries, to foster ties and economic exchanges, this would create new economic opportunities in the form of reciprocal trade agreements and in a sense reassert the influence of the United States in Latin America in a friendly manner."

If we don't do this, this situation could spiral out of control and lead us to a capital shortage and further the economic recession."

With the economy in shambles and unemployment so high, our maturing young adults have a particularly bleak outlook for the future. Therefore, we should resolve to create a public work relief program, already known as the Civilian Conservation Corps, or CCC. The agency will ensure we can provide stable pay and good labor to those looking to work while guaranteeing the conservation of America’s stunning landscape and the development of her natural resources in rural areas."

 USA_Alleviate_Household_Unemployment: "Alleviate Household Unemployment"
 USA_Alleviate_Household_Unemployment_desc: "Beyond the youth unemployment situation, many who were already in the workforce have been humiliated by layoffs and company restructures. Somewhat like the Civilian Conservation Corps, creating the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA) would provide a pathway for positions within the federal government. While these would be basic jobs in newly established public lands and facilities, the importance lies in the self-esteem and psychological benefits of having a secure vocation and restoring trust in the United States’ government."

It seems counter-productive, but at present, many consumables are stagnating in warehouses, due to a massive stockpile from farmers unable to sell at competitive prices. Using the FSCC, we can use federal money to purchase the extras and distribute them to families who desperately need them. Less waste, more haste."

However, it has inadvertently caused some other problems due to it’s ineffective and uneven enforcement. The law has resulted in an increase in crime and has made the general populace agitated and disgruntled, which is not something we want considering the circumstances our nation finds itself in. To keep our country united in these trying times, and acquire more support for our government, we should make the obvious choice and repeal the amendment."

 USA_Raise_Food_Prices: "Raise Food Prices"
 USA_Raise_Food_Prices_desc: "In order to further the economic recovery, being able to provide food on the table is a source of great American pride. While the Agricultural Adjustment Act was a good start, further value manipulation is needed to restore trust in goods. Raising the prices ever so slightly would provide a scarcity effect, thereby stabilizing the supply and demand of foodstuffs. This way, the cost of certain items would remain the same over a longer period of time and not fluctuate from week to week. A small act to return faith in the open market."

 USA_Push_Public_Works_Budget: "Boost the Public Works Budget"
 USA_Push_Public_Works_Budget_desc: "As the global Great Depression continues, several new economic theories have emerged. The most prominent of these, the school of Keynesian Economics, has the seemingly counterintuitive idea that the best way to recover from our economic woes is to start spending. Keynesians suggest that during recessions, the most important influence on economic output is demand, rather than supply, and that the government can stimulate demand by spending money on public works projects.\n\nBy investing large amounts of money into infrastructure projects like new schools, roads, bridges, airports, hospitals, and dams, we can provide our nation's workers with steady jobs and decent pay. With their most basic needs taken care of, Americans will finally be able to spend again, putting customers back in long-shuttered stores."

 USA_Reduce_Agricultural_Surplus: "Reduce Agricultural Surplus"
 USA_Reduce_Agricultural_Surplus_desc: "While the FSCC deals with the surplus food at a higher level, the difficult issue must be attacked at the roots. The Agricultural Adjustment Act is designed to do just that. Once passed, it will subsidize farmers to NOT plant on certain sections of their lands. Furthermore, the government will buy excess livestock in order to keep the prices of cattle competitive. While we are hoping farmers will be able to rally and profit after the depression ends, it is vital we make sure that overproduction does not halt initial agricultural gains. After such a disastrous economic collapse, we must relearn to walk before we can run."

With the hardships of the depression, many important civil construction projects have been shelved indefinitely. This has provided another opportunity for getting Americans back to work. Included in the National Industrial Recovery Act, the Public Works Administration will provide contracts to private construction companies to hire unemployed construction workers and begin creating these projects. Roads, schools, railroads, hydroelectric dams, bridges and airports are only a few of the potential proposals for the administration. More than wealth, however, it could prove a multiplier for the stagnant economy, raising the future prospects of the nation as a whole."

But these policies are long in coming and implementation, the average citizen needs work as soon as possible if he is to survive these testing times. As part of the ”New Deal” being implemented nationwide, the President has decreed the formation of the Civil Works Administration to generate short term jobs for the most affected echelons of the society, the CWA will provide manual work to many by undertaking several public works and construction projects, though a solution, it is suitable for a short term duration only, instead the nation requires long term policies by the Federal government to be able to fully ever eliminate mass unemployment."

 USA_Protect_Currency: "Protect the Dollar"
 USA_Protect_Currency_desc: "As part of the New deal reforms aimed at combating the effects of the Great Depression in the country, the President has decided to pass the Gold Reserve Act. With the passage of this act the statutory price of gold will be increased, incentivizing imports of gold into the country, for whose accumulation the US Department of Treasury will be responsible. The act while encouraging gold miners all over the world to sell their gold in the USA will also devalue the dollar and hence reduce deflation. The increase in gold reserves will lead to an increase of the money supply in the Country, allowing for the counteracting of the ill effects of the current economic turmoil by the administration."

Originally created to mobilize political support for the new department, it is displayed in factories and shops, by companies, to show compliance or support for the National Recovery Administration. Provided to many employers, posters, letterheads and many other items are promoting a return to national pride in work.

 USA_Provide_Affordable_Power_desc: "Even by Depression standards, the Tennessee Valley of the southern states is in extremely dire economic conditions. Forests are burned each year by fire, and the best timber has already been slashed and sapped. Depleted farms and fields have ruined the agricultural prospects, leading to some families having an annual income of less than $100. With malaria rates creeping in the low 30%, outside observations of third world settings are difficult to reject. Creating a federal corporation, specifically for the valley, would spur new economic opportunities. Rural electrification, large infrastructure projects and promoting better cultivation methods would go a long way to empowering and modernizing the American south."

 USA_Abandon_Gold_Standard: "Abandon the Gold Standard"
 USA_Abandon_Gold_Standard_desc: "By tying the dollar to gold, we are not giving ourselves the best chance possible of recovering from the Great Depression. The gold standard has forced the government to keep interest rates high in order to protect the gold reserves, but this has made it too expensive for people to borrow. This situation must be resolved immediately. Once we abandon the gold standard, we will then be able to print more money and lower interest rates, which should hopefully stimulate the economy, and bring us back on track."

 USA_Reduce_Fraudulent_Wall_Street_Activities_desc: "Right now in the country, the sale of securities is regulated by state laws termed as ”Blue Sky Laws”. These laws only allow the offering and sale of securities on a purely ”merit review” basis, making investment in new and upcoming businesses very prohibitive. The federal government in an attempt to create better ”disclosure” for investors, curb some of the unethical practices prevalent in the market and to reencourage investment by the public has decided to pass the Federal Securities Act. The law as part of the ”New Deal” by the President will in essence allow investments into any and all public companies, as long as all the necessary information is provided to the prospective investor."

 USA_Restore_Confidence_in_the_Banks: "Restore Confidence in the Banks"
 USA_Restore_Confidence_in_the_Banks_desc: "One of the primary reasons for the Great Depression was the widespread panic about the American banking system due to fears over the strength of the institutions. Bank runs, sudden demands by large numbers of customers to withdraw all their funds at almost the same time, brought down many banking corporations as depositors attempted to withdraw more money than the bank had available. In order to win back the public’s trust and to encourage them to deposit their money, the Federal government will be creating the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Although the new organization has many duties, its prime objective will be to provide insurance to depositors in both commercial and savings banks, and it will be aided in its efforts by the US Department of Treasury, who will be providing a direct line of credit."

 USA_Road_Goes_Both_Ways_desc: "Our tariff rates are among the highest in the world, and our protectionist policies are sure to be having an effect on not only the global recovery from the Great Depression but our own as well. To counteract this, we must make a complete reversal and sign into law the Reciprocal Tariff Act. This bill will not only begin to liberalize our trade policy but will allow the President himself to negotiate with foreign nations to reduce their tariffs in return for a reduction of our tariffs. This will usher in a new age of trade and should play a part in stimulating the global recovery from this economic crisis that we find ourselves in."

 USA_Regulate_Securities_Exchange: "Regulate the Securities Exchange"
 USA_Regulate_Securities_Exchange_desc: "While the Federal Securities act has been largely successful in promoting ethical practices, its main jurisdiction is in the ”primary” market, i.e. it tailors only to the exchange between the company and the investor, leaving the ”secondary” market, which involves third parties, free to continue to employ exploitative practices. In pursuant to the government’s objective to promote a free and fair market, where individuals always have full ”disclosure” about the companies they intend to invest in, the Federal government will be enacting the Federal Securities Exchange Act. This act will finally allow the practice of ”disclosures” to be extended to the secondary market."

The president’s work, however, is far from over. Until the end of his term, he will attempt to enact the second stage of his plans, a ”Second New Deal”. The bills and policies that Roosevelt intends to pass will tackle issues that are rooted deep in society and will create a strong foundation to build upon in the future. He will have to remain politically astute, however, as his political capital is not unlimited, and if he drops the ball, he could open himself up to a challenge from the Republican’s in the next election."

 USA_Expand_Youth_Program: "Expand the Youth Programs"
 USA_Expand_Youth_Program_desc: "As the Great Depression has continued to grip the American economy, unemployment and poverty have spiraled to record highs. These debilitating years have seen youth unemployment rise to 30% as the younger cohorts of the United States increasingly face the devastation of not being able to afford education. The New Deal needs to focus on the youth of our generation as well, or we may very well lose an entire generation if no action is taken. By Executive Order 7086, a new federal agency will be formed, the National Youth Administration, which will provide grants to youth in exchange for part-time work positions in various sectors of the education system along with vocational programs and occupational placements in a wide variety of fields, including recreation, public service, education, the arts, research and development, agriculture, and construction. The youth are the future of the nation, and under the guidance of the National Youth Administration, they will ensure a bright future for America."

The current administration as part of the New Deal, has heavily revised Senator Black’s initial draft to pass the Fair Labor Standards Act. The revised proposal will allow for an eight-hour day and a forty-hour work week, and workers will earn wages for an extra four hours of overtime. Along with this, a minimum wage will be established, and overtime pay must be one-and-a-half times regular pay. Children under eighteen will be denied from working in dangerous conditions, and children under sixteen cannot work in the manufacturing or mining industries or during school hours. This act has received a great deal of support from the President himself, meaning that it will pass without issue."

This image of apathy is not something we want to project to the world, and certainly not to our own people, so something has to change.

 USA_Relieve_Puerto_Rico_desc: "Puerto Rico since its incorporation into the country has always been neglected. Its economy is heavily tied and dependent on the mainland through a series of economic arrangements that heavily favor US companies who hold monopoly over the whole cash crops sector. Even before the Great Depression, negative developments on the island and world economies perpetuated an unsustainable cycle of subsistence for many Puerto Rican workers. Generally, the living standards are very low and dangerous working and living conditions cause high mortality rates due to workplace accidents and diseases such as dysentery, diarrhea, malaria, and tuberculosis. To develop and fix the sorry state of affairs on the island, the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration has been created, falling under the authority of the Department of the Interior and the Farm Security Administration. Its primary goals will be to establish long term economic stability in Puerto Rico through job creation, land distribution, public works projects, as well as environmental and health initiatives. The task of developing Puerto Rico may be an arduous one, but one that is necessary and critical for national development."

However, in recent times the price of oil has fallen dramatically, causing some serious damage to the petroleum industry. The Connally Hot Oil Act, named after Senator Tom Connally, will be enacted to protect the industry from "contraband oil," cartelizing the industry to stabilize the falling prices of oil. Along with this objective, it will also grant the President authority to prohibit the transportation of petroleum that is produced or withdrawn from storage in excess of the amount permitted by the necessary Federal authorities. Though this act may be viewed as excessive, it is a necessary step to safeguard America’s Petroleum industry."

Right now the nation is mired by an unprecedented economic crisis, the likes of which the world has never seen before, millions are unemployed, many are starving everyday, but the ”Big Companies” in their lofty offices in Chicago, New York and the other metropolitan areas continue to wean off the poor, they hoard, they withhold salary checks, lay off workers without any due warning. They have become the dark side of the ”Opportunities” of America, exploiting the populace in midst of the hardships they face, the Companies need to be reminded of their duty to the nation which has supported them.

However, while the ”High” society still has many of its comforts, the middle and lower echelons have been pushed to the brink of destitution and desolation. The Revenue Act aims to soak the rich, penalize bigness, and help balance the budget by raising federal income tax on higher income levels. By introducing the "Wealth Tax”, incomes over $1 million per year will be liable to pay. There is strong opposition from businesses, the rich, and conservatives from both parties about such a measure, but America needs to recover, and to recover it needs every section of the Society to do its part, sacrifices must be made."

 USA_Ressetle_Dust_Bowl_Families_desc: "A series of severe dust storms have greatly damaged the ecology and agriculture of the American and Canadian prairies, they have caused a severe drought and a failure of dryland farming methods to prevent the wind erosion, with unanchored soil turning to dust, which the prevailing winds blew away in huge clouds that blacken the sky, forming massive choking billows of dust. Thousands of stricken and affected families are in need of immediate help, Rexford Tugwell an advisor to the President has been tasked with heading the Resettlement Administration. Among its duties, its primary goal would be to relocate the struggling urban and rural families. A massive undertaking, the government plans to resettle destitute families from agriculturally exhausted, worn-out land to green-belt cities, which would act as models for a cooperative agriculture future."

Federal Project Number One, also referred to as Federal One, is the collective name for a group of planned projects under the Works Progress Administration, a New Deal program in the United States. Each of these projects will cater to the needs of each of their respective art category, to prevent undue Federal influence on the artisans and their works, all projects will operate without discrimination regarding race, creed, color, religion, or political affiliations."

 USA_an_Act_of_Neutrality: "An Act of Neutrality"
 USA_an_Act_of_Neutrality_desc: "The long standing view and the conviction of many Americans is that the U.S. entry into the Great War had been orchestrated by bankers and the arms industry for profit reasons, this and other factors have strengthened the position of isolationists and non-interventionists considerably in the government. While the President himself is opposed to neutral policies, believing that they would restrict America's ability to help friendly nations, and even though he can technically veto to prevent such a policy from coming into effect, right now the domestic issues are so far flung that the President cannot afford to lose any of the Congressional support, lest he be unable to fully implement all of the New Deal legislations and the reforms he intends to carry out in the country. Due to his own reasons regarding the political front and the general populace’s support for isolationism, the president will be signing the Neutrality act, which effectively officiates America’s isolationist and non-interventionist stance."

 USA_A_Defense_Against_Agression_desc: "Despite what the country’s policy makers intended with an isolationist stance, it seems every friend of America or any other Democracy for that matter is threatened, be it across the Atlantic or across the Pacific. Thousands have died in the last few years, while Americans have been sitting with their hands bound, long has such sordid state of affairs gone and on with no end in sight. The President has ordered the government to prepare the nation to protect itself from any and all manners of aggression, aid will be extended to friends of America who have long waged war against evil and the unjust. America is a giant, a sleeping one at that, it will be woken up from its slumber to protect Democracy and Liberty across the breadth of the globe."

 USA_Prevent_Another_Bonus_Army: "Prevent Another Bonus Army"
 USA_Prevent_Another_Bonus_Army_desc: "The Bonus Army was a group of demonstrators – made up of 17,000 veterans, together with their families and affiliated groups - who gathered in Washington, D.C. in mid-1932 to demand early cash redemption of their service certificates which could not be redeemed until 1948, the media referred to them as the \"Bonus Army\" or \"Bonus Marchers\". Many of the war veterans had been out of work since the beginning of the Great Depression. Eventually on orders of the then-President Herbert Hoover the demonstration was driven out by General MacArthur. As the Great Depression has continued, there is every possibility that such an incident will happen again, despite the President’s protests the Congress has decided to pass the Adjusted Compensation Payment Act to compensate the veterans early. Veterans will be issued with US Treasury Bonds as a form of economic stimulus and relief, as it is estimated that many bonds will be cashed in promptly and constitute an efficient economic stimulus since little government administration is needed, the monies will likely be spent without delay, and the entire process does not require the long lead time of a public works program."

 USA_the_US_Army: "The US Army"
 USA_the_US_Army_desc: "The US Army is the branch of the United States Armed Forces responsible for its ground and airborne assets. With our country’s entry in the Great War, the Selective Service Act of 1917 was enacted to expand the Army through conscription. The Subsequent end of the conflict led to the decrease in strength of the Army. Today dark clouds loom all over Europe and in Asia. Instability and tensions threaten Europe, while Japan’s sun is rising all over the Pacific, in all cases despite our neutrality, involuntarily we may be well pulled into a conflict the likes of which the world has never seen. The US Army historically has never been a particularly strong one, the British have the Battle of Waterloo, the Germans the Battle or Sedan, and the French the Battle of Austerlitz, the US Army’s limited experience include fighting its own countrymen, a few embarrassing battles in Mexico, and a few battles near the end of the Great War. The President has asked Edward Burke and James Wadsworth to begin drafting the Selective Training and Service Act to allow for the first time ever, peacetime conscription in the United States of America."

 USA_Call_National_Guard_into_Active_Service: "Prepare to Federalize the National Guard"
 USA_Call_National_Guard_into_Active_Service_desc: "The United State Army since its inception has been small, in times of conflicts the small numbers of the Regular Army were supplemented by state militias. After the Militia Act of 1903, the state militias were organized into the National Guard, which assumed the roles and duties of the state militias. Today despite repeated American declarations of neutrality and despite our attempts to promote and foster peace, it seems that our country would most likely be involuntarily drawn into a conflict. The United States Army is after much hesitancy, finally being expanded and reformed, but for all intents and purposes the National Guard remains the general reserve of the Army and must be prepared to be activated as soon as possible."

 USA_the_Louisiana_Maneuvers: "The Louisiana Maneuvers"
 USA_the_Louisiana_Maneuvers_desc: "The US military as a whole has not been tested since the Great War, and as such, has fallen behind many of the other armies across the world. With tensions rising in Europe and across the world, we need to ensure that it is modernized and fully prepared for combat as soon as possible. The first step is to evaluate the current quality and readiness of our troops, officers and logistics, which we shall do by scheduling large-scale war games in the wide, open territories of Louisiana. As soon as these exercises are completed, we can then begin the long and time-consuming process of revamping and modernizing the systems already in place."

 USA_Eisenhower_Grand_Battleplan: "Eisenhower's Grand Battleplan"
 USA_Eisenhower_Grand_Battleplan_desc: "General Dwight D. Eisenhower is a rising star throughout the US Army, and rightly so. His ability to organize is second to none and he fully understands the importance of extensive planning and analysis. The general is also a strong leader, recognizing the need to delegate in order to keep his eyes on the big picture. If we are to get involved in a large scale war with multiple fronts that extend for miles and miles, our Chief of Army will need to be a capable leader that can plan and organize effectively. Eisenhower fits that description perfectly."

 USA_Reorganize_Field_Command_Structure: "Reorganize Field Command Structures"
 USA_Reorganize_Field_Command_Structure_desc: "In accordance with the emphasis being placed upon the planning and strategic aspect of the war, the Army Staff has decided to streamline and create uniform field structures for the units within the army. Currently, our field command structures are cumbersome, bloated and carry a lot of dead weight, hamstringing them and preventing quick, decisive actions from being made. This makes the units far less effective in the heat of battle, and leaves them vulnerable to surprise counter-attacks and other unforeseen enemy movements due to the lengthy communication channel between various levels of field command. This much-needed reform will unfortunately weaken the army in the short term, but its benefits on the battlefield will be demonstrated for all to see once it's done."

 USA_Marshall_Overwhelming_Firepower: "Marshall's Overwhelming Firepower"
 USA_Marshall_Overwhelming_Firepower_desc: "The effectiveness of artillery was proven in the Great War with both its physical and psychological effects taking a toll on the enemy and playing a substantial role in their defeat. With manpower a precious commodity despite its abundance, it would be rather wise to reform our way of thinking to along the lines of throwing easily produced shells at the enemy rather than soldiers, who are considerably harder to replace. A proponent of this style of warfare, General George C. Marshall, is also a highly capable organizer and leader, a perfect fit for the position of Army Chief of Staff."

 USA_Tank_Destroyer_Doctrine: "The Tank Destroyer Doctrine"
 USA_Tank_Destroyer_Doctrine_desc: "Tanks and other mechanized vehicles will almost certainly be the main weapons our troops will face if we engage an enemy on the battlefield. Those armored beasts will provide a great challenge and if used effectively, could absolutely decimate our forces. Regardless of what other tactics we employ, we must prevent this from becoming reality. The plan will be to allocate plenty of resources to developing and coming up with anti-tank strategies and technologies, which will surely give our troops the best chance possible of defeating their adversaries."

 USA_Make_Thunder_Louder: "Make the Thunder Louder"
 USA_Make_Thunder_Louder_desc: "Since the army has fully embraced the Shock and Awe doctrine support by General George C. Marshall, we have now come to a small roadblock to the complete implementation of these tactics:\n\nOur guns simply don't have enough firepower to provide the overwhelming amount of destruction needed to ensure the neutralization of all but the most sturdy enemy positions.\n\nTo remedy this banal, yet relatively simple problem, the government, with the enthusiastic support of the Army high command, has decided to immediately issue contracts for the designing and construction of a variety of large caliber guns."

 USA_Patton_Advance_Armour: "Patton's Armored Advances"
 USA_Patton_Advance_Armour_desc: "The use of tanks and other armored vehicles in a spearhead attack instead of in their traditional role of infantry support is a new and radical idea that is increasing in popularity across the world. With our army currently in the phase of reformation and modernization, now would be the perfect time to adopt a fresh doctrine that could potentially throw our enemies off-balance. To usher in this new era of warfare into our armed forces, there would be no better man than the bold, decisive, General George S. Patton. A natural leader, he has advocated for this style of warfare for years and would certainly be the best choice for Army Chief of Staff."

 USA_Use_of_Combined_Arms: "The Use of Combined Arms"
 USA_Use_of_Combined_Arms_desc: "For the last half of his career, George S. Patton has been petitioning the War Department about the need for the U.S. Army to adopt and train combined arms units. Inspired by the ideas of Charles DeGaulle, Heinz Guderian, and Erwin Rommel, his arguments center around swift moving armoured strikes with close infantry and artillery support. Patton has been developing his theory of battle over his whole life, starting in the Great War.\n\nPatton has further developed his ideas with an experimental unit in Hawaii, and his ideas have shown merit in the recent Louisiana Maneuvers. Maybe it's time to acknowledge and look into these new tactics?"

 USA_Form_Airbone_Division: "Form Airborne Divisions"
 USA_Form_Airbone_Division_desc: "Analysts in the Department of War responsible for observing and analyzing foreign military capabilities have recently spoken about a novel concept of using large formations of airborne troops, after witnessing their usage and demonstrations by some of the armies in Europe. Their usage is varied and flexible, they can be employed for seizing key points such as bridges to speed up the advance of the traditional ground forces, or for risky yet rewarding maneuvers to create ”vertical envelopments”, i.e. to cut off retreating paths of the enemy formations to encircle and destroy them, with the paratroopers acting as the anvil and the ground armies hammering to destroy the enemy army. Keeping the interest of the nation at heart and the opinions of several of our strategic experts, the formation of several division-sized airborne units for the Army has been ordered."

 USA_Cavalry_of_the_Future: "The Cavalry of the Future"
 USA_Cavalry_of_the_Future_desc: "According to a few radical generals, advancements in the field of warfare have made the role of conventional cavalry and to an extent, the foot soldier, obsolete. These men often provide the example of General John J. Pershing’s costly frontal assaults during the Great War, which caused massive casualties to further their case. These theorists stray away from the conventional school of thinking and propose that tanks and other armored vehicles are the way to win the wars that are sure to come. Whatever may be the case, the infantryman is supposed to be slow, while our cavalry is supposed to move fast and strike hard. However, this is not necessarily the case. The current cavalry fielded by the US Army is cumbersome, slow and often extremely vulnerable, and it is obvious that the rules of warfare have changed. Whether they may be used for infiltration tactics or in conjunction with armor, the first step to evolve our Army into a modern, capable of force would be to equip them with motorized transport along with the likes of light armored vehicles such as scout cars which will sufficiently answer the long drawn question of how to provide troops with mobility along with adequate protection."

 USA_Sherman_Tank: "The Sherman Tank"
 USA_Sherman_Tank_desc: "Working upon its predecessor - the M3 medium tank, which was supposed to be a stopgap measure, the US Army Ordnance Department has come up with the design of the M4 ”Sherman” Medium Tank. Working upon past domestic lessons, while inculcating some through the British and Canadian inputs, the M4 Sherman has been designed to be cheap, reliable and of adequate quality, the Tank is supposed to be highly reliable owing to the utilization of a vertical volute spring suspension, rubber-bushed tracks, and a rear-mounted radial engine with drive sprockets in front and light enough to be easily loaded onto cargo ships and trains for quick transportation overland and overseas. Its chassis is also versatile and can be adopted for a host of other roles, which all add to the value of this particular armored vehicle."

 USA_Better_Equipement_Better_Results: "Better Equipment, Better Results"
 USA_Better_Equipement_Better_Results_desc: "The regular infantryman is the backbone of any army, and if they are not supplied with the best equipment and resources on offer, that backbone will be weak. This is an unacceptable possibility. In order to keep the army as strong as possible and keep our great nation as safe as possible, we must stay ahead of the curve and relentlessly continue improving upon the equipment and tools currently provided. This may be a simple equation, but it’s true nevertheless: Better equipment yields better results."

 USA_Information_on_the_Battlefield: "Information on the Battlefield"
 USA_Information_on_the_Battlefield_desc: "While true for every situation in life whether it be politics, the economy in general, or which store has the best goods, everywhere you will find that Information is the main ingredient for success, no matter how influential the other circumstances are.\n\nGeneral Eisenhower is well aware of this simple rule of life and has fully embraced it in his long and successful time of commanding troops, with his commanding doctrine revolving around the acquisition of every bit of information available and the subsequent creation of Plans A to Z.\n\nWith the Army now fully embracing the "Broad Front" theory supported by Eisenhower, we should do everything in our power to improve our battlefield and military reconnaissance, so that when the need arises every commander has the right intel directly at his disposal."

 USA_Broad_Front: "The Broad Front"
 USA_Broad_Front_desc: "General Eisenhower's rise has been a long and difficult one, starting the thirties as commander of a small unit in Washington State his military theory now determines most War Department policy. Put simply Eisenhowers policy would allow all field armies to better communicate and coordinate their actions to move forward in any given theater. This would allow our armies to be able to slowly but surely push back the enemy in a sort of slow methodical wave. Although counterintuitive The Broad Front would help to save lives and material and ensure that no US Army should be destroyed in detail. Only a few more techniques are needed to truly perfect this strategy for us."

 USA_Instill_Fear_Into_Enemy_Pilots: "Instill Fear Into Enemy Pilots"
 USA_Instill_Fear_Into_Enemy_Pilots_desc: "We will not always have friendly faces in the skies. That is just the reality of war. The effects of enemy aerial superiority have proven to be devastating on ground troops, and if we are to prevent our armies from making the mistakes as other armies, being decimated from the skies, we must make some serious investments into developing effective anti-air technology. These strides forward will make our armies capable of defending themselves from attack from the air and will make those enemy pilots think twice about flying towards their potential demise."

 USA_Improve_Gun_Motor_Carriages: "Improve the Gun Motor Carriages"
 USA_Improve_Gun_Motor_Carriages_desc: "With the Army's efforts to upgrade its fire power capacity the Brass have sent down the order to start development of upgraded motor gun carriages. A relatively new concept in the world of warfare, Motor Gun Carriages are heavy artillery on treads, a cheap and relatively easy way to get heavy artillery fire closer to the battlefield with less risk and more maneuverability. Usually made from the hull of a tank these vehicles will help make our new doctrine pay the most dividends in combat."

 USA_Shock_and_Awe: "Shock and Awe"
 USA_Shock_and_Awe_desc: "Many of our Generals who served during the Great War learned hard lessons about the nature of modern war. For George C. Marshall, it was the primacy and tactical power of Artillery and aerial bombardment. Through the interwar years Marshall has had the chance to study and test many of his ideas. Now with the position of Army Chief of Staff he can make the final reforms necessary to make his doctrine the prevailing one throughout the entire Army. The United States industrial power has made Marshall's plans a reality, with overwhelming artillery and other supporting attacks the US Army should be able to simply blast its way through any enemy lines."

 USA_the_Only_Sure_Defense_is_Offense_desc: "The United States Military is technologically advanced, well funded, and has a strong industrial base to build on, which isn’t something that can be said for most other militaries around the world. We must use these things to our advantage, take risks, be aggressive on the battlefield and relentlessly push back the enemy, regardless of the conditions. This may be reckless to some, but if you don’t march forward and stay on the front foot, you won’t get closer to the enemy’s capital, and if you don’t take risks, you won’t win a war."

 USA_Armoured_Research_Development_Program: "Armored Research-Development Program"
 USA_Armoured_Research_Development_Program_desc: "Armored vehicles like tanks are sure to be the most common weapon used in war for the next few decades. To ensure American dominance on the battlefield in these times, we must stay ahead of the curve technologically by constantly creating new and innovative ideas. However, we shouldn’t work alone. It would be prudent to work together with another democratic nation on this endeavor, as not only will the process be quicker, we can pool together our expertise and create a high-quality tank that will benefit both parties."

 USA_Attack_Attack_Attack: "Attack, Attack, and Attack Some More!"
 USA_Attack_Attack_Attack_desc: "George Patton is one of the more radical and aggressive officers serving in the US Army and dedicates a special emphasis on offensive operations. While he has his fair share of detractors, his theory of continuously and relentlessly attacking the enemy offers a large number of merits suitable to America’s strengths. He advocates the usage of large bodies of armored vehicles as leading a furious and relentless charge against the enemy to prevent him from regrouping and organizing a defense to the point where he’s so exhausted that he cannot offer any significant resistance and our troops can simply brush him aside."

 USA_Expand_Engineer_Batallion: "Expand the Engineer Combat Battalion"
 USA_Expand_Engineer_Batallion_desc: "The Role of the US Army Corps of Engineers was instrumental in our victory in the Great War, and they will play a pivotal role in future engagements. From the construction of makeshift bridges at important crossings, to sabotage behind enemy lines, engineers provide a wide variety of military applications. Due to our isolation from the European Theater, it may become necessary for engineers to assist in naval assaults. If we want to be able to fight a war in Europe or the Pacific, we need to expand their capabilities, and provide them with a closer integration with their division."

 USA_M47_Patton: "The M47 Patton"
 USA_M47_Patton_desc: "Field usage of the current generation of Heavy Tanks has proven their capabilities to be seriously lacking, the M26 Pershing has seen to be having insufficient mobility and being very unreliable. Working upon our past lessons and addressing the immediate need of a sufficiently armored and gunned tank of the heavy category while boasting the mobility of lighter tanks; knowing the M46 was a stopgap solution and the T42 will not be possibly ready for field deployments anytime soon with officers of the Armored Force having serious misgivings about its projected performance, the M47 Patton Tank has been proposed. The M47, named in honor of our country’s foremost proponent of tank warfare, boasts the turret of the T42 mounted on the existing M46 hull, while some are voicing concerns over the M47 being another stopgap solution, army officials feel the improvements over the M46 in firepower and armor are worth the risk. Already the Detroit Arsenal has designated a production line for the production M47, as soon as the final research work and field trials are completed."

However, in our view, the projection of power beyond the horizon by these new weapons is a monumental step forward in both land and naval warfare.\n\nTherefore, we should embark on a program of designing new and modern aircraft carriers, purpose built for bombers and armaments. However, it shouldn't be forgotten that our fleets already contain several converted light carriers. Modernizing that inventory, enlarging flight decks and aircraft capacities, should be a continued focus as well. Bolstering those with a modest investment in screen ships technologies, this program will add new and dynamic strength to our carrier forces from coast to coast."

 USA_Follow_in_the_Footsteps_of_the_Great_White_Fleet_desc: "Our 26th President, Teddy Roosevelt, had many different sayings for all sorts of topics, but when it came to his foreign policy, he needed only to keep it brief: ”Speak softly, but carry a big stick!” His Great White Fleet was the culmination of America’s first major refitting of the Navy since the turn of the century. Sixteen battleships, all dressed in red, white and blue banners, traversed the globe on a journey to promote peace, prosperity and most of all, power. The stark painted-white hulls left an impression upon the globe that the United States could and would project her might wherever it need be. \n\nWith those original ships now themselves obsolete in most naval theatres, it is time to regain our prestige upon the seven seas. Battleships will be prioritized, with new investments in screen ships to add a layer of protection. Old hulls will be refitted and expanded, new hulls will be manned and gunned to the fullest. By scaling up our battleship inventory and capabilities, we will once again promote American’s shining image to the nations of the world"

The constant march of progress proves too much, even for the mightiest vessel. The introduction of the third theatre, the airspace, has proven a bitter pill to swallow for shipbuilders and admirals. However, in our view, the projection of power beyond the horizon by these new weapons is a monumental step forward in both land and naval warfare. \n\nTherefore, we should embark on a program of designing new and modern aircraft carriers, purpose built for bombers and armaments. However, it shouldn't be forgotten that our fleets already contain several converted light carriers. Modernizing that inventory, enlarging flight decks and aircraft capacities, should be a continued focus as well. Bolstering those with a modest investment in screen ships technologies, this program will add new and dynamic strength to our carrier forces from coast to coast."

 ### 1936 - FDR
 USA_Third_Deal: "A Third Deal"
 USA_Third_Deal_desc: "President Roosevelt’s first term policies and legislation were dominated by his promises of a ”New Deal” for the American people. True to his nature, Roosevelt followed through on those words, passing into law effective bills and proposals in the ”First” and ”Second” New Deals. Now with his mandate renewed and the American people’s absolute confidence, a ”Third New Deal” is well on its way. More liberal in substance than the past two, this third stage of legislation will prove to be more difficult to enact into law, but hopefully, well worth the fight."

 USA_Create_Housing_Authority: "Create Housing Authority"
 USA_Create_Housing_Authority_desc: "Even before the Depression, low-income families and the homeless were suffering from poor living conditions that affected their quality of life and chances for success. According to classic Progressive theory, the improvement of the situation of poorer citizens will very likely also improve their social behavior and their economic contribution to society. Created as a result of the Housing Act proposed by Senator Wagner and Representative Steagall, the United States Housing Authority is going to be an agency dedicated to lending money to the states to finance low-cost public housing projects. The provision of safe sanitary dwellings for the families with low income not only will reduce crime, but will also help to combat unemployment."

 USA_Market_Pacific_Power: "Market Pacific Power"
 USA_Market_Pacific_Power_desc: "Access to electricity remains one of the biggest differentiators between urban and rural areas. Since expanding wires and electric poles into rural areas is an unprofitable activity due to utility costs, only a few of them. To remedy this situation, the Bonneville Power Project is a hydroelectric project in the Columbia River that will guarantee full access to electricity in at least nine states of the Pacific Northwest at the same cost that urban areas. This agency will only be temporary until a full regional power authority can be established. Promoting rural electrification will increase the profits of the farms and improve the infrastructure of the West Coast."

 USA_Farm_Security_Administration: "Farm Security Administration"
 USA_Farm_Security_Administration_desc: "The FSA is a reorganization of the Resettlement Administration and the Federal Emergency Relief Administration. While it’s directive is to combat rural poverty, figuring out how to best do that is more difficult. Rural Rehabilitation tactics include purchasing submarginal land owned by poor farmers and increasing education and literature opportunities. Continuing the groundbreaking photography program should also be a priority, showing the plight of the forgotten America class toiling away on their downtrodden farms, to the rest of the American people and the entire globe."

 USA_Packing_the_Court: "Packing the Court"
 USA_Packing_the_Court_desc: "Though most of the president’s proposals in the First and Second New Deals were made into law, some of our suggestions faced stern opposition from the Supreme Court, which argued that they were ”unconstitutional”. Since most of the justices that sit on the court will not be leaving any time soon, we have come up with a creative solution — to increase the number of people who sit on the bench, allowing us to appoint liberal-leaning justices that will support any of our future plans. It will be no easy feat to get this bill to pass, but if we do, we could secure the Supreme Court for the Democratic Party for decades to come."

To maintain what momentum we do have, we must put our judicial reform bill on the chopping block. It is simply not smart to expend all our energy and time on a controversial piece of legislation that may not even pass. It’s mightily unfortunate, but if we want the rest of the president’s agenda to have a hope in hell of passing through the Congress and the Senate, we must make the sacrifice."

 USA_Empower_Federation_of_Labour_desc: "Due to the Great Depression, the common worker across America has faced unimaginable pain and hardship, working tirelessly each day just to barely scrape by, if that. To compound the reality of a weak economy, their employers seek to take advantage of them and exploit their efforts. Thankfully, due to President Roosevelt's New Deal programs, not only is the economy on its way to bouncing back, but meaningful change has been enacted in the working place, with labor unions becoming more and more influential throughout the country.\n\nTo continue consolidating this progress, the American Federation of Labor, an alliance of these ever-growing labor unions, should be strengthened and protected further in order to make sure that the American worker continues to have his interests represented. The "American Dream" turned to a nightmare nearly a decade ago, and as we look to bring it back, we should ensure that every working man has as equal an opportunity as another to grasp it."

 USA_Second_Social_Security_Act: "Second Social Security Act"
 USA_Second_Social_Security_Act_desc: "With the Supreme Court in favor of President Roosevelt’s government due to the liberal majority, we now have a chance at passing some legislation that would have previously been impossible to pass. The first of this new, even more liberal legislation will be a second Social Security Act. By building upon our efforts in the first term and further strengthening the safety net, we can provide aid to those who are in desperate need of it and alleviate the pains of poverty, giving as many of our citizens as possible the opportunity to live the American Dream that was promised to them."

 USA_Cash_and_Carry_Provisions: "Revise the Neutrality Act"
 USA_Cash_and_Carry_Provisions_desc: "One of America’s political traditions is keeping the country outside of foreign affairs that do not involve the continent. Recent times with the rise of totalitarian regimes have demonstrated that maintaining this tradition is not an option. However, with the trauma of the Great War still present, the American population remains hostile to any kind of significant involvement in other nations. Fortunately, we found a way to work around that. With the war in Spain raging on, the recent Neutrality Act proposed by the Republicans forbids the sale of weapons and the transport of U.S citizens to countries in conflict. But thanks to a provision we added, we are allowed to transport raw materials and supplies to the belligerent nations on Europe. This will allow us to support those democracies under the threat of fascism without alienating the population."

 USA_Implement_Fair_Labor_Standards: "Implement Fair Labor Standards"
 USA_Implement_Fair_Labor_Standards_desc: "In order to further our rebound from the crushing depths of the great depression, making sure workers are paid and employed fairly would provide another layer of stability in the employment sector. The Labor department has come up with an agenda, the Fair Labor Standards Act, which would create a model for working conditions. These effects include: a standard minimum wage, time and a half pay for overtime and most importantly, removing minors from the oppressive child labor system. This will be a cornerstone of future labor law, and will give laborers pride and prestige in their job."

 USA_Regulate_Aeoronautics_Industry: "Regulate the Aeronautics Industry"
 USA_Regulate_Aeoronautics_Industry_desc: "America’s civilian aircraft industry has grown organically since Wilbur and Orville Wright took the first flight from Kitty Hawk. While this growth has lent us the largest civilian fleet in the world, it is a massive bureaucratic mess. Air mail lines, extended passenger demands, and trans-atlantic traffic all lead to a patchwork of airports, pilots, and aircraft vying for space above North America. Introducing the Civilian Aeronautics Act to regulate and develop air transportation will start the process of peeking through the muck. It will bolster our national defense at a particularly tense time in global politics while encouraging further widening of our domestic and international commerce in the skies."

 USA_Loans_Private_Sector: "Loans to the Private Sector"
 USA_Loans_Private_Sector_desc: "The Great Depression has crippled the ability of a private citizen to invest and to save, as the banks containing their savings closed and their shares they had invested in turned worthless overnight. The Private sector has died out in the severe crisis the country is experiencing, neither the private citizen can fund it nor can it provide job opportunities, to revive it, there is a need for an influx of cash and capital that can be used to further the sector, invested back into the national economy in infinitely possible ways. With the President’s and the Congress’ approval the Federal government will be releasing a massive financial package, with more than its fair share of subsidies and loans earmarked to bring back the private sector on its own feet."

 USA_Ensure_System_Integrity: "Ensure System Integrity"
 USA_Ensure_System_Integrity_desc: "Rumors have come to our attention that members of our party are using the alphabet agencies to push their own political careers. Several local Democratic politicians in swing states like Kentucky and Pennsylvania have been caught in a scheme. After being consulted on Works Progress Administrators and caseworkers before they were hired, some officials took patronage and political contributions in return for employment in the agency. While an official investigation has found inconclusive findings, we have decided to push forward with the Hatch Act, which will prevent all employees of the executive branch, minus the president and vice-president, from engaging in any form of political activity. We must maintain good governance, especially in these dark times."

 USA_Reorganize_Executive: "Reorganize the Executive"
 USA_Reorganize_Executive_desc: "There hasn’t been a major planned reorganization of the executive branch since it’s creation in 1787, nearly 150 years ago. However, the modern presidency and the United States as it exists today, must be able to adapt to change quickly. The Reorganization Act of 1939 will do this, granting the President the authority to hire additional confidential staff while allowing reorganizations of the government’s branch’s staff. While some say this will limit the influence of the Cabinet and cast a shadow on executive privilege, the Act does come with certain limits and all adjustments are subject to legislative vetoes. This should allow the president more breathing room and governmental evolution in terms of policy"

 USA_Executive_Office_President: "The Executive Office of the President"
 USA_Executive_Office_President_desc: "The President of the United States needs help. He is like any other mortal man and needs the proper support structure in place if he is to govern effectively. In the past, president’s were hamstrung by this lack of support, and their administrations could never fulfil their potential. This must change immediately if President Roosevelt's administration and any future ones are to succeed. By establishing the Executive Office of the President, order will be brought to the White House, and the necessary foundation for any great government will be put in place."

 USA_Federal_Security_Agency: "Federal Security Agency"
 USA_Federal_Security_Agency_desc: "President Franklin D. Roosevelt has signed in the "Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1939", under the authority of the Reorganization Act of 1939. The reorganization plan is designed to reduce the number of agencies reporting directly to the president, by clubbing several smaller organizations directly under a single management, that can better assess the resources and ensure a more judicious of resources. The reorganization plan will create the Federal Security Agency, included in the FSA will be the Social Security Board, the U.S. Public Health Service, the Food and Drug Administration, the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Office of Education, the National Youth Administration and a number of several other smaller agencies."

 USA_Expand_the_RFC: "Expand the RFC"
 USA_Expand_the_RFC_desc: "In 1932 Eugene Meyer, a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors suggested the formation of an organization modelled on the lines of US War Finance Corporation of the Great War, the suggestion was accepted and recommended by the then President Herbert Hoover. The organization formed was the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, a government corporation administered by the United States Federal Government, its stated purpose is to provide financial support to state and local governments and made loans to banks, railroads, mortgage associations, and other businesses. Among the sweeping reforms, President Roosevelt is carrying out as part of ”The New Deal”, he has issued a directive to reassert the RFC by expanding it, its scope will be expanded and will include helping in economic recovery by taking proactive measures to boost the country’s confidence and help the banks, many which are struggling resume daily functions."

 USA_Federal_Works_Agency: "Federal Works Agency"
 USA_Federal_Works_Agency_desc: "As part of the first ever planned reorganization of the executive branch of the government of the United States since 1787, various Federal agencies and institutions are being clubbed into fewer but larger ”catch all” agencies, pursuant to the recently enacted reorganization plans authorized by the Reorganization Act. The Federal Works Agency (FWA) will act as an independent agency of the federal government of the United States, administering a number of public construction works, building maintenance, and public works relief functions and laws. At the present due to the economic conditions in the country, its mission will be expanded, it will construct public works, such as parks, water treatment systems, roads, and buildings, employ the unemployed to construct such works, and to issue loans and grants to regional authorities, states, counties, and localities for the construction of public works on the lines of providing fair work to the citizens of America."

But this time the stakes are too high, extremist movements have sprouted and matured all over Europe and seem to be motivated to destroy and uproot the democratic way of life, wherever it still stands. The United States has the global responsibility of preserving peace and democracy, and must help the democracies of Europe in their fight against extremism, while our domestic policies may prevent the President to directly intervene in the war, vital material aid should be made available to all the countries, be it in Europe or Asia in their fight against the extremist aggressors."

 USA_Food_Stamp_Plan: "Food Stamp Plan"
 USA_Food_Stamp_Plan_desc: "With the British appeal for more aid and supplies, and an ever increasing probability that our peace loving country would be pulled unwillingly into the global conflict, currently raging across Europe and Asia, critical resources need to be conserved. Any day our factories may be ordered to switch over production from tractors to tanks, a war industry requires several materials that are taken for granted during times of peace. The Federal government has issued necessary directives to the suitable authorities to begin planning for a massive Food Stamp System to be implemented across the country, for the preservation of food stocks and other necessary resources."

 ### 1936 - Landon
 USA_Landon_Boom: "The Landon Boom"
 USA_Landon_Boom_desc: "Despite being an ineffective campaigner who rarely travels, Alf Landon won the 1936 presidential elections, defeating Roosevelt against all the odds and expectations. The majority of the attacks on Roosevelt and Social Security were developed by Republican campaigners rather than Landon himself, alongside his failure to make any campaign appearances two months after his nomination.\n\nDespite all this, he was able to come out on top and persuade the public that he will fix the economy and effectively fight the Great Depression, something Roosevelt was unable to do during his previous term."
 USA_Fair_Compromise: "A Fair Compromise"
 USA_Fair_Compromise_desc: "When it comes to the things that make us a nation of happy families, the New Deal has failed miserably. The evidence is in the record. According to the record, the primary need in 1933 was for unemployed people to find work. According to the record, the primary need in 1936 is still jobs for the unemployed.\n\nThe time has come to put an end to this futile attempt at recovery. American initiative is not a commodity that can be purchased in pound increments from a government agency. It is a vital force in our nation's life, and it must be liberated!\n\nThe country is ready to recover. We are far behind in our expenditures for maintenance, improvements, and expansion. This demand totals billions of dollars in industry, new businesses, our homes, and on our farms. When all of this consumer demand is released, the issue will not be where to find work for the workers, but where to find workers for the work."
 USA_End_Economic_Hostility: "End Economic Hostility"
 USA_End_Economic_Hostility_desc: "Landon admired and respected Roosevelt and supported much of the New Deal until Roosevelt became corrupt and subverted the Constitution for power and influence. However, Landon has always claimed that the New Deal was anti-business and involved excessive waste and inefficiency.\n\nNow that Landon is president, it is time to begin reforming the New Deal into something truly efficient, free of excessive and unnecessary government spending, capable of addressing both social issues that plague our citizens while also supporting businesses."
 USA_Encourage_Private_Investment: "Encourage Private Investment"
 USA_Encourage_Private_Investment_desc: "President Landon has proposed encouraging private sector investment in various businesses. This has the potential to increase working capital in businesses: Private equity firms can provide the cash infusion required to support a new or struggling business.\n\nFurthermore, it allows for greater growth freedom: Companies that receive investments from institutions such as venture capital firms may do so at an earlier stage of development, allowing them to try different growth strategies to help shape their business."
 USA_Cut_Welfare_and_Pension_Spending: "Cut Welfare and Pension Spending"
 USA_Cut_Welfare_and_Pension_Spending_desc: "Crushing debts and taxes are typically incurred, as they are today, in the name of assisting people — the same people who must eventually pay them. They invariably impede prosperity and, in some cases, result in situations in which people's rights are violated. This is a historical lesson that we have witnessed in the modern world.\n\nNothing is more important to our party than getting our financial house in order. We must re-establish accountability in the handling of government finances for the sake of all of us. We must acknowledge that a government does not have an infinite amount of money to spend. It must manage its resources with the same zeal as the head of a family. Unless it takes this path, it will be unable to provide the services that the people expect."
 USA_Begin_to_Balance_Budget: "Begin to Balance the Budget"
 USA_Begin_to_Balance_Budget_desc: "Landon was well-liked as governor of Kansas, and he earned a reputation for lowering taxes and successfully balancing the budget. Now he must apply his abilities not to a single state, but to the entire country. The New Deal cost the government an absurd amount of money while also harming our economy.\n\nThe federal government's spending increased from $697 million in 1916 to $9 billion by 1936. It is time to review and rebalance the New Deal Budget, reducing wasteful and excessive government spending and undoing some of Roosevelt's damage to this country."
 USA_Implement_Tax_Break: "Implement Tax Breaks"
 USA_Implement_Tax_Break_desc: "Increasing debts and taxes pose a threat to all of our objectives. They consume funds that could be used to create new things or reduce the cost of existing goods. Taxes, both visible and hidden, raise the cost of everything. They leave less for family security by taking more and more from the family purse. Let us not be misled by those who claim that others will be forced to bear our burden.\n\nA simple examination of the facts and figures reveals that our growing debts and taxes are so massive that, even if we tax those who are best able to pay the most, the average taxpayer will still bear the lion's share. While spending billions of dollars of borrowed money may give the appearance of prosperity for a short time, we and our children, as taxpayers, still have to pay the bill. We will return two dollars for every dollar spent! We must be free of wasteful spending and crippling taxation once and for all."
 USA_Support_Small_Business: "Support Small Business"
 USA_Support_Small_Business_desc: "The launching of new business ventures was one of the signs of the end of previous depressions. True, the majority of them were small. However, they collectively employed millions of people. This demand for work has not yet appeared during the current recession. A few new businesses have begun. Why? Because the small businessman, the working man who wants to be his own boss—the average American—has been hesitant to strike out on his own. He has little faith in the soundness of federal policy and is concerned about what might happen next.\n\nWe must dispel his fear, restore his confidence, and re-establish our faith in the initiative, intelligence, and courage of these job creators and opportunity creators. That is why the time has come to free the spirit of American enterprise from its shackles."
 USA_Lower_Tax_Burden: "Lower the Tax Burden"
 USA_Lower_Tax_Burden_desc: "We must be free of the government's constant intimidation and hostility. We must be free of wasteful spending and crippling taxation. We must be free of the consequences of an arbitrary and unpredictable monetary policy. And we must be liberated from private monopolistic control through strict enforcement of anti-trust laws.\n\nOnce these steps are taken, the energies of the American economic system will be able to reverse the effects of the depression and restore full activity and employment. President Landon has proposed a new Tax Law to accomplish this, and Congress will soon begin debating the issue."
 USA_Soften_Regulations: "Soften Regulations"
 USA_Soften_Regulations_desc: "As a young man, Landon was drawn to the idea of concentrating all power in the Federal Government to correct the abuses that resulted from a more complex social order. Landon, like everyone else, was disappointed when the people rejected this alternative. Nonetheless, he has lived to see many of those abuses substantially corrected by the forty-eight state legislatures in their respective fields, as well as by the Federal Government in its field of interstate commerce.\n\nAs a small independent oil producer, Landon witnessed his industry seek Federal regulation due to selfish exploitation of a natural resource that, once depleted, cannot be replenished. When federal regulation failed, the industry made progress toward a solution by turning to state action, supplemented by interstate compacts as provided by the Constitution's amazing foresight."
 USA_Shift_to_Fiscal_Conservatism: "Shift to Fiscal Conservatism"
 USA_Shift_to_Fiscal_Conservatism_desc: "President Landon has reached his limit. All of our wrangling with the New Dealers is severely limiting and slowing our economic recovery and growth. Every reform Landon wants to push through, every bill he proposes, every new economic issue he wants to tackle, he is never fully in control, always having to find some kind of compromise with the New Dealers.\n\nNot any longer. It is time for the United States' economic policy to shift away from the New Deal and toward Fiscal Conservatism, as Landon has advocated since taking office. Allow the New Dealers to whine all they want; this is the only way to ensure a quick recovery."
 USA_Continue_the_Compromise: "Continue the Compromise"
 USA_Continue_the_Compromise_desc: "While Landon may be a fiscal conservative at heart, the New Dealers make some valid points. Landon agrees with the New Dealers on some points, such as the need for the government to address certain social issues.\n\nDespite the fact that the economy is not recovering as quickly as Landon had hoped, the compromise with the New Dealers has earned him widespread support in both the political and public arenas. The common ground between Landon and the New Dealers can be used to our advantage in the future, even if it does limit our options slightly."
 USA_Make_Publc_Works_Private: "Make Public Works Private"
 USA_Make_Publc_Works_Private_desc: ""We have built up new instruments of public power," the former President boasted. He was correct when he said that these instruments could "shackle the liberties of the people and enslave the public." These abilities were granted with the understanding that they would be limited in time. But, once the powers were obtained and the emergency was clearly over, we were told that giving up the power would cause another emergency.\n\nIn other words, Roosevelt's concentration of power was not a matter of temporary emergency. It was a matter of long-term national policy. The 1933 emergency was merely an excuse. The former Administration's policy of national economic planning violates the fundamental ideals of the American system. Economic planning comes at a cost of economic freedom. And economic liberty and personal liberty are inextricably linked."
 USA_Empower_National_Civic_Federation: "Empower the National Civic Federation"
 USA_Empower_National_Civic_Federation_desc: "The National Civic Federation is a business organization founded in 1900 that brings together selected representatives of big business and organized labor, as well as consumer advocates, to try to resolve labor disputes. It advocates for moderate progressive reform and works to settle disputes between industry and organized labor.\n\nThe government must maintain its position as an umpire for two reasons: first, to protect the public interest, and second, to act as a mediator between opposing groups. One of the most pressing issues confronting this country is the development of effective conciliation methods. Taking a tangled dispute and rushing it to the President's door is a bad way to handle a labor situation or any other situation."
 USA_Implement_Protectionist_Tarrifs: "Implement Protectionist Tariffs"
 USA_Implement_Protectionist_Tarrifs_desc: "President Landon intends to impose a number of tariffs in order to raise the price of imported goods in the domestic market. This will provide our local industries with more opportunities for growth until they can compete against more experienced firms in the international market, resulting in higher employment rates when domestic firms increase their workforce.\n\nFurthermore, it will help to reduce import levels, allowing us to improve our trade balance and boost GDP due to an increase in domestic production. Although this will not be popular with the general public, it is a necessary step in the recovery of our economy, and the people will be grateful in the future."
 USA_Support_Gas_Companies: "Support the Gas Companies"
 USA_Support_Gas_Companies_desc: "Landon began his career in banking before becoming an independent petroleum producer in Independence, Kansas, in 1912. By 1929, his oil industry career had made him a millionaire, and he was instrumental in the formation of the Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association, a petroleum lobbying organization.\n\nLandon understands the importance of oil and gas to the country, and the companies that supply it are a critical component of our industry. As a result, the president wishes to assist these businesses by subsidizing some of the largest and most important ones."
 USA_Reform_Tax_Code: "Reform the Tax Code"
 USA_Reform_Tax_Code_desc: "Following all of the previous tax reforms, such as tax breaks and the new tax law, which have reduced the tax burden, it is now time to completely reform the tax code itself. The common man and average taxpayer will no longer be crushed under the weight of excessive taxes that he cannot afford. No more hidden taxes that sneak up on unsuspecting victims, ready to take the last of their hard-earned money.\n\nThis is a critical step in the effective reorganization of the numerous Government agencies in order to eliminate unnecessary ones, eliminate duplication, ensure better administration, and save taxpayer money."
 USA_Fair_Labor_Management_Relations: "Fair Labor-Management Relations"
 USA_Fair_Labor_Management_Relations_desc: "Under pressure from the National Child Labor Committee and the National Consumers League, Congress passed the Keating-Owen Act in 1916, which prohibited interstate commerce of goods produced by employees under the ages of 14, 15, or 16, depending on the type of work.\n\nOn June 2, 1924, Congress approved a constitutional amendment that would allow Congress to regulate "labor of persons under the age of eighteen" and sent it to the states for ratification.\n\nAmong all the reforms and economic policies, this issue has resurfaced in Congress, where it is being hotly debated, with proponents on both sides making valid arguments for and against it."
 USA_Get_The_Party_Fall_In_Line: "Get the Party to Fall in Line"
 USA_Get_The_Party_Fall_In_Line_desc: "A lot of Republican Party members continue to criticize President Landon for abandoning cooperation with the New Dealers and the New deal policies and shifting the economy to fiscal conservatism.\n\nThese individuals must understand that the Republican Party must unite now more than ever in order to maintain a free competitive system—a system in which, and only in which, there can be independence, equality of opportunity, and work for all.\n\nLandon has scheduled a meeting with Lane, one of the Republicans who oppose Landon's fiscal conservatism, to explain the situation and gain his support."
 USA_Work_Acroos_the_Aisle: "Work Across the Aisle"
 USA_Work_Acroos_the_Aisle_desc: "If we are to move forward indefinitely, we must do so as a united nation, not as a people torn apart by prejudice and divided by class or political party. Cooperating with the New Dealers has demonstrated that, even when we disagree, there is always room for discussion and compromise. Alf Landon has accomplished something that few believed was possible when he was first sworn in as president.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans, New Dealers and Fiscal Conservatives, almost the entire nation, are working together as never before to combat the Great Depression and return to prosperity and stability. Landon has now scheduled a meeting with John Nance Garner and Sam Rayburn to discuss their support and the support of the Democrats down the line."
 USA_New_Threats_to_the_World: "New Threats to the World"
 USA_New_Threats_to_the_World_desc: "Every day, the situation outside of the United States becomes more volatile. To say the least, the rise of National Socialism in Europe is concerning. Meanwhile, the Japanese Empire is at war with China, with the goal of conquering all of Asia. If they are successful, it could pose a serious threat to our country. We can't ignore the fact that sooner or later, we'll have to either join the conflict voluntarily or be dragged into it, whether we like it or not. We must gradually shift our focus back to rearmament and hope that it is sufficient and that we will be ready when the time comes to take up arms again."

 USA_Better_A_Third_Termer_Than_A_Third_Rater: "Better a Third Termer than a Third Rater"
 USA_Better_A_Third_Termer_Than_A_Third_Rater_desc: "Franklin D. Roosevelt has been elected to a third term as President in an unprecedented turn of events. Although not yet enshrined in the Constitution, George Washington established the two-term tradition when he refused to run for a third term in the 1796 presidential election. Farley and Vice President John Garner are dissatisfied with Roosevelt's decision to disregard Washington's precedent.\n\nHowever, as Germany sweeps through Western Europe and threatens Britain, Roosevelt realized that only he has the experience and skills to guide the country safely through the Nazi threat. He is aided by the party's political leaders, who feared that no Democrat other than Roosevelt could have defeated the popular Republican nominee, Wendell Willkie. In response to Willkie's attacks, Roosevelt promises to keep the United States out of the war."
 USA_Prepare_For_Intervention: "Prepare for Intervention"
 USA_Prepare_For_Intervention_desc: "The task of the people in Washington's day was to create and weld together a nation. The task of the people in Lincoln's day was to protect the nation from internal disruption. Today, the people's task is to save the nation and its institutions from external disruption.\n\nIn the midst of fast-paced events, there has come a time for us to pause for a moment and take stock—to recall our place in history and rediscover who we are and what we might become. If we don't, we risk the real dangers of isolation and inaction.\n\nWe can no longer ignore the Nazi threat or the suffering of our allies. If we continue to be plagued by inaction, the light of democracy and freedom will be extinguished all over the world, and our great nation will be doomed to the whims of the Japanese and Germans."
 USA_Arsenal_Of_Democracy: "Arsenal of Democracy"
 USA_Arsenal_Of_Democracy_desc: "The Army and Navy are being expanded and re-equipped, and we are gradually becoming a "Arsenal of Democracy" for Britain and the other democratic Allies. The term "Arsenal of Democracy" refers to the collective efforts of American industry in supporting the Allies, which are concentrated in our country's established industrial centers.\n\nRoosevelt delivered a speech calling to arms for supporting the Allies in Europe and, to a lesser extent, the Republic of China in their total war against Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. The speech was a resounding success, possibly signalling the end of the isolationist and non-interventionist doctrine that has dominated our foreign policy since our entry into the Great War."
 USA_Begin_to_Shift_Economy_to_War_Footing: "Begin to Shift Economy to War Footing"
 USA_Begin_to_Shift_Economy_to_War_Footing_desc: ""The preservation of the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government are justly considered deeply, finally, staked on the experiment intrusted to the hands of the American people," our first President said in his first inaugural address in 1789, words that seem almost directed to this year.\n\nIf we lose that sacred fire, if it is suffocated by doubt and fear, we will reject the destiny that Washington fought so valiantly and triumphantly to establish. The preservation of the nation's spirit and faith is and will be the highest justification for any sacrifice made in the name of national defense.\n\nIn the face of unprecedented dangers, our steadfast goal is to safeguard and perpetuate democracy's integrity. For this, we must summon the spirit and faith of America. We do not withdraw. We are not content to remain stationary. By the will of God, we proceed as Americans in the service of our country."
 USA_USACE_Projects: "USACE Projects"
 USA_USACE_Projects_desc: "The Engineer Regiment, military construction, and civil works are the primary missions of the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The Engineer Officers' Reserve Corps and the Engineer Enlisted Reserve Corps became one of the branches of the Army after the National Defense Act of 1916 authorized a reserve corps.\n\nMany politicians wanted the Corps of Engineers to contribute to both military and civil construction from the start. We can use the USACE for military construction missions, such as building facilities in the United States and abroad to support the United States Army and Air Force. These projects include aircraft, tank assembly, and ammunition plants, as well as soldier camps, depots, ports, and hospitals.\n\nThe Corps of Engineers is the lead federal navigation and flood control agency on civilian projects. Congress dramatically expanded its civil works activities, becoming a major provider of hydroelectric energy and the country's leading provider of recreation. Its role in responding to natural disasters also expanded dramatically, particularly after the devastating Mississippi Flood of 1927."
 USA_Pro_War_Propaganda: "Pro War Propaganda"
 USA_Pro_War_Propaganda_desc: "There are men who believe that democracy, as a form of government and a way of life, is limited or measured by a mystical and artificial fate in which tyranny and slavery have become the surging wave of the future—and freedom is an ebbing tide. But we in America know that this is not the case.\n\nNo, democracy is not on its way out. We know because we've seen it resurrect—and grow. We know it can't die because it's based on the unhindered initiative of individual men and women united in a common enterprise—an enterprise undertaken and carried out by the free expression of a free majority. We know this because, of all forms of government, democracy alone enlists the full force of men's enlightened will. We know this because democracy alone has built an infinite civilization capable of infinite progress in human life improvement. We know it because, if we look beneath the surface, we can see it spreading on every continent—because it is the most humane, advanced, and ultimately unconquerable of all forms of human society."
 USA_the_Inevitable_War_Must_Be_Paid: "The Inevitable War Must be Paid"
 USA_the_Inevitable_War_Must_Be_Paid_desc: "This country is putting forth great effort to produce everything required in this emergency as quickly as possible. And this enormous effort necessitates enormous sacrifice. The failure of the government to protect the economic well-being of its citizens will not erode the nation's strength. If machines limit our ability to produce, it is important to remember that these machines are operated by the workers' skill and stamina.\n\nBecause the government is determined to protect workers' rights, the nation has a right to expect that the men who operate the machines will devote their full attention to the urgent needs of defense. War is on its way to us, whether we accept it or continue to live in denial. Every citizen of the country must contribute to the nation's armament effort, whether with their own hands or their hard-earned money."
 USA_Rearm_The_Military: "Rearm the Military"
 USA_Rearm_The_Military_desc: "All of our current efforts are insufficient. More ships, guns, planes, and everything else is required. And we can only do so if we abandon the concept of "business as usual." This job cannot be completed simply by adding the nation's defense requirements to the existing productive facilities. Those who are concerned about the future consequences of excess plant capacity must not stymie our defense efforts. The potential consequences of our defense efforts failing are now much more frightening.\n\nThe nation's goal is to build every machine, arsenal, and factory needed to manufacture defense material as quickly as possible. We have the men, the skills, the wealth, and, most importantly, the will."
 USA_Land_Lease_Act: "The Lend-Lease Act"
 USA_Land_Lease_Act_desc: "Roosevelt, with the help of Willkie, has won Congressional approval for the Lend-Lease program, which will provide massive military and economic aid to Britain, China and the Soviets. In sharp contrast to the Great War loans, there will be no repayment after the war. The material provided under the act is provided at no cost and is to be used until returned or destroyed.\n\nThis effectively ends the United States' pretence of neutrality, which was enshrined in the 1930s Neutrality Acts and represents a decisive shift away from non-interventionism and toward open support for the Allies.\n\nAs Roosevelt takes a firmer stance against Japan, Germany, and Italy, American isolationists such as Charles Lindbergh and the America First Committee slam him as an irresponsible warmonger."
 USA_Office_of_Coordinator_of_Inter_American_Affairs: "Office of Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs"
 USA_Office_of_Coordinator_of_Inter_American_Affairs_desc: "Roosevelt has authorized the establishment of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs to counter perceived German and Italian propaganda efforts in Latin America. Previously known as the Office for Coordination of Commercial and Cultural Relations between the American Republics, it was led by Nelson Rockefeller.\n\nThe Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs in the Executive Office of the President has now been formally established and enacted by US Executive Order 8840 by President Roosevelt, who appointed Nelson Rockefeller to the position of Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs. The agency's mission is to promote inter-American cooperation, particularly in commercial and economic matters.\n\nThe mission of the agency is to counter Italian and German propaganda in the region. The FBI will train friendly nations' secret police, German military sales will be phased out, and pro-German newspapers and radio stations will be blacklisted and replaced with pro-American propaganda."
 USA_the_Giant_Wakes: "The Giant Wakes"
 USA_the_Giant_Wakes_desc: "Japan has launched a surprise offensive that will span the Pacific. Yesterday's and today's facts speak for themselves. The people of the United States have already formed their opinions and are well aware of the implications for our country's very life and safety.\n\nAll measures must be taken to protect ourselves. But our entire nation will remember the nature of the onslaught against us forever. No matter how long it takes to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American people will triumph in their righteous might. We will not only defend ourselves to the fullest extent possible, but we will also ensure that this type of treachery never happens again.\n\nThere are hostilities. There can be no doubt that our people, territory, and interests are in grave danger. With faith in our armed forces and the unwavering determination of our people, we will achieve the unavoidable victory – so help us God."
 USA_Expand_Office_Civilian_Defense: "Expand the Office of Civilian Defense"
 USA_Expand_Office_Civilian_Defense_desc: "President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8757, establishing the Office of Civilian Defense, a federal emergency war agency established to coordinate state and federal measures for civilian protection in the event of a war emergency. Fiorello La Guardia, an attorney and politician who currently serves as the 99th Mayor of New York City, will be the first person to hold the position as head of the office.\n\nIts two branches oversee protective functions like blackouts and special fire protection, as well as "war service" functions like child care, health, housing, and transportation. It also established the Civil Air Patrol, a non-profit corporation chartered by Congress and funded by the federal government that serves as the official civilian auxiliary of the United States Air Force."
 USA_A_Special_Relationship: "A Special Relationship"
 USA_A_Special_Relationship_desc: "If the United Kingdom falls, the Axis powers will control Europe, Asia, Africa, Australasia, and the high seas. And they will be able to deploy massive military and naval resources against this hemisphere. It is not an exaggeration to say that we would all be living at the point of a gun, a gun loaded with explosive bullets, both economic and military. We would be entering a new and terrifying era in which the entire world, including our hemisphere, would be ruled by threats of brute force.\n\nIn terms of military power, the United Kingdom and the British Empire are currently at the forefront of global resistance to conquest. And they are putting up a fight that will live on in the annals of human valor. We have provided significant material assistance to the British and will continue to do so in the future. There will be no "bottlenecks" in our determination to assist the United Kingdom. Their power is increasing. It is the courage of men and women who value their freedom more than their lives."
 USA_Sell_War_Bonds: "Sell War Bonds"
 USA_Sell_War_Bonds_desc: "Series A savings bonds were issued in 1935 to encourage people to save during the Great Depression. They were marketed as a safe investment that anyone could make. Over the next few years, they were followed by series B, C, and D bonds.\n\nThe first Series E bond, marketed as a defense savings bond, was sold to President Franklin D. Roosevelt on May 1, 1941, by Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau. Series E bonds were renamed war bonds following the attack on Pearl Harbor and our entry into the war.\n\nWhen it comes to selling the war bonds, the "drive" technique used during the Great War is being partially replaced by a continuous campaign using a payroll deduction plan. This should allow us to hopefully raise enough money to fund this costly war."
 USA_War_Production_Board: "The War Production Board"
 USA_War_Production_Board_desc: "With Executive Order 9024, President Roosevelt established the War Production Board, a United States government agency that will oversee war production during the war. The Supply Priorities and Allocations Board and the Office of Production Management will be replaced by the War Production Board.\n\nThe War Production Board will direct the conversion of companies engaged in war-related activities from peacetime to war-related needs, allocate scarce materials, establish priorities in the distribution of materials and services, and prohibit non-essential production. Gasoline, heating oil, metals, rubber, paper, and plastics will also be rationed. Donald Nelson, a business executive and public servant, will serve as the Board's first chair."
 USA_Reserve_Companies: "The Reserve Companies"
 USA_Reserve_Companies_desc: "The Federal Reserve plays an important role in our country, helping to finance wartime spending, fund our allies, embargo our adversaries, stabilize the economy, and plan the return to peacetime activities.\n\nThe handling of war savings bonds is the Federal Reserve Banks' largest single operation. The Federal Reserve is working closely with the Treasury to organize and administer the war loan drives. Assist in the preparation and distribution of publicity materials such as manuals and letters of instruction to drive workers, printing and distribution of subscription blanks, and tabulation of detailed reports on drive results.\n\nThe Reserve Banks issue savings bonds directly to the public and maintain consignment accounts with thousands of banks and other agents who issue savings bonds as fiscal agents. The Reserve Banks coordinate their activities as well as the activities of thousands of volunteers and businesses who assist in the bond marketing."
 USA_Draft_Atlantic_Charter: "Draft the Atlantic Charter"
 USA_Draft_Atlantic_Charter_desc: "In a highly classified bilateral meeting, Roosevelt and Churchill drafted the Atlantic Charter, which conceptually outlines global wartime and post-war goals.\n\nThe joint statement outlines the following goals for the post-war world: no territorial aggrandizement, no territorial changes made against the wishes of the people, restoration of self-government to those who have been deprived of it, reduction of trade restrictions, global cooperation to secure better economic and social conditions for all, freedom from fear and want, freedom of the seas, abandonment of the use of force, and disarmament."
 USA_Stick_to_American_Principles: "Stick to American Principles"
 USA_Stick_to_American_Principles_desc: "Some academics have criticized or dismissed the idea of Japanese-American internment camps, arguing that "disloyalty" on the part of some individual Japanese Americans could not justify incarcerating hundreds of thousands of people, including infants, the elderly, and the mentally ill. They claim that Japanese Americans are not acting on Imperial Japan's invitation to spy on the United States, and that any speculations or "evidence" that these people are spying on us have long been refuted and discredited.\n\nWhile it may appear tempting at first to proceed with the establishment of internment camps and combating the potential security risk that these Japanese Americans pose, we would be no better than the dictators we oppose. For Japanese-Americans as well as Americans, America is built on freedom and individual liberties. The scholars are correct, and we cannot proceed in good faith unless we have the evidence to back up our claims and justify our actions."
 USA_Establish_Internment_Camps: "Establish Internment Camps"
 USA_Establish_Internment_Camps_desc: "Not long ago the president authorised Executive Order 9066, which allows regional military commanders to designate "military areas" from which "any or all persons may be excluded". This authority is being used to declare that all Japanese-Americans must leave Alaska, as well as the military exclusion zones that cover all of California and parts of Oregon, Washington, and Arizona.\n\nIn accordance with the Alien Enemies Act, Presidential Proclamations 2525, 2526, and 2527 designated Japanese, German, and Italian nationals as enemy aliens. Officials in the United States have used information gathered over the previous decade to track down and imprison thousands of Japanese-American community leaders.\n\nThose with as little as one-sixteenth Japanese ancestry are being interned, with the US Census Bureau assisting incarceration efforts by providing specific individual census data on Japanese Americans. These measures are intended to mitigate the security risk that Japanese Americans are perceived to pose."
 USA_Office_Scientific_Research_Develpoment: "The Office of Scientific Research and Development"
 USA_Office_Scientific_Research_Develpoment_desc: "The President issued Executive Order 8807, formally establishing the Office of Scientific Research and Development, a federal agency of the United States created to coordinate scientific research for military purposes during the war. It supersedes the work of the National Defense Research Committee, has nearly unlimited funding and resources, and is led by Vannevar Bush, who reports only to President Roosevelt.\n\nProjects will focus on new and more accurate bombs, reliable detonators, proximity fuze research, guided missiles, radar and early-warning systems, lighter and more accurate hand weapons, more effective medical treatments, and more versatile vehicles."
 USA_Expand_Budget_Signal_Security_Agency: "Expand the Budget of the Signal Security Agency"
 USA_Expand_Budget_Signal_Security_Agency_desc: "The Signal Security Agency, formerly known as the Signal Intelligence Service, is a codebreaking division of the United States Army that was established in 1930 to compile codes for the Army. It is a branch of the United States Army Signal Corps. The Signal Corps, among other things, provides the Army with communications and photography equipment and services. The Signal Corps also prepares personnel and signal units for service with field forces.\n\nPresident Roosevelt authorized an increase in the Signal Security Agency's budget in order to begin intercepting Soviet intelligence traffic sent primarily from New York City. The code name "Venona" was assigned to the project. Despite our alliance with the Soviet Union, many of our officials remain skeptical of the communist government and society."
 USA_Haven_For_Scientists: "A Haven for Scientists"
 USA_Haven_For_Scientists_desc: "The United States has become a true haven for scientists as a result of President Roosevelt's efforts. We have invested heavily in new federal research agencies, increased the budgets of existing agencies, and motivated and encouraged scientists across the country to work as hard as they have never worked before.\n\nOur efforts are finally paying off and are beginning to show their value. We are making rapid progress in various fields of research, primarily in new technology and equipment that can be used to supply our armed forces and gain an advantage in battle, but also in the civilian field, which will boost our industrial capacities even further."

 USA_Theres_No_Indispensible_Man: "There's No Indispensible Man"
 USA_Theres_No_Indispensible_Man_desc: "Wendell Willkie has accomplished the almost impossible. He can now push for much-needed economic and social reforms after defeating Roosevelt and becoming President of the United States. Willkie will not make the same mistakes that Roosevelt had made in the last administration.\n\nWillkie promises to keep New Deal social welfare programs intact, expand Social Security, and provide full employment, a job for everyone: "I pledge a new world". Furthermore, he promises to keep the United States out of the war, which Roosevelt would not have done."
 USA_Strengthen_Social_Security: "Strengthen Social Security"
 USA_Strengthen_Social_Security_desc: "For all his excessive spending, Roosevelt did not go far enough in strengthening our social security system. Willkie's campaigned on expanding the country's Social Security system, and this will be one of his first acts as president.\n\nEven though Willkie strongly opposes spending even more money than we already do because of New Deal social welfare programs, this is an issue close to Willkie's heart because he has always been committed to social security and social justice, especially since working as a lab assistant in Puerto Rico in his youth and witnessing workers being abused."
 USA_Prepare_Aid_Packages: "Prepare Aid Packages"
 USA_Prepare_Aid_Packages_desc: "Instead of simply adding more New Deal social welfare programs that bloat our bureaucracy and create even more unnecessary expenses, we need to ensure that help goes directly to those who need it the most.\n\nWe will prepare aid packages for citizens who are unable to support themselves and must rely on government assistance. While this is only a short-term solution, it is the best option for the time being until Willkie's social and economic reforms are completed, and citizens will benefit faster and more than from this than from social welfare programs."
 USA_Slash_Taxes: "Slash Taxes"
 USA_Slash_Taxes_desc: "The New Deal used its taxing authority for political purposes. It has levied taxes to punish one man, to force another to do something he did not want to do, to target a third person whom some government agency disliked, or to fund the experiments of a brain-trust. The direct result of the New Deal taxes has been a reduction in opportunity.\n\nTaxes will now be levied in accordance with each individual's ability to pay. The primary goal of levying them will be to raise funds. We need to — and can — raise more money at a lower relative cost to the people. We must do so without imposing the current disproportionate burden of hidden taxes on the poor."
 USA_Streamline_the_New_Deal: "Streamline the New Deal"
 USA_Streamline_the_New_Deal_desc: "Roosevelt's biggest blunder was the New Deal's excessive and unnecessary spending. The previous administration spent sixty billion dollars. And there must be something wrong with a theory of government or a theory of economics that allows us to have less opportunity after spending such a large sum.\n\nAs frequently stated, the New Deal believes that the government's spending of vast sums is a virtue in and of itself. They claim that government spending guarantees recovery. What happened to the recovery? We must replace the philosophy of spending with the philosophy of production. Every man who works in this country, whether with his hands or his mind, will have to work a little harder in the months ahead."
 USA_Begin_to_Rearm: "Begin to Rearm"
 USA_Begin_to_Rearm_desc: "We must not ignore the importance of preparing our sons to care for themselves if the defense of America leads to war. We cannot ask the American people to believe in us unless we state unequivocally that some form of selective service is the only democratic way to secure the trained and competent manpower we require for national defense.\n\nNo man is wise enough to know what the future holds or to plan for it. Nobody can guarantee the preservation of peace. Peace is not something that a country can achieve on its own. It also depends on what other countries do. Adopting a foreign policy that commits the US to future action under unknown circumstances is neither practical nor desirable.\n\nIn the foreign policy of the United States, as in its domestic policy, we will do everything to defend American democracy and we will refrain from doing anything that would injure it."

 USA_Get_the_People_On_Our_Side_desc: "For the first time in our history, American industry has stagnated for a decade. It provides no more jobs today than it did ten years ago, despite the fact that there are 6,000,000 more people looking for work. We have become stagnant as a producing nation. A large portion of our industrial machinery is obsolete, and in addition, the national standard of living has fallen.\n\nThe fact that the New Deal failed in its economic rehabilitation program is no longer a political accusation. And those who suffer as a result of its failures are the very people whose cause it claims to champion.\n\nPresident Willkie has called a rally in Seattle to reassure the public and explain his next steps. He will make a personal appearance and deliver a speech in the hopes of convincing the public that his path to recovery is the right, and more importantly, the only path to recovery."

 USA_Loosen_the_Noose_of_Neutrality_desc: "It is difficult for us to comprehend how the war in Europe can affect our daily lives. We instinctively turn away from the recurring conflicts over there, the diplomatic intrigue, and the power shifts that the previous war failed to end.\n\nBut we also know instinctively that we are not alone in our suffering. We live in the same world as they do and are made in their image. People in all of the democracies that have recently fallen were living the same peaceful lives that we do. They shared similar views on human liberty, and their trade and exchange methods were similar to ours. We cannot, no matter how hard we try, remove the pitiful image of their annihilation from our minds, nor can we ignore the profound consequences for the world in which we live."

 USA_Enlarge_Military_Industry_desc: "We will extend to the opponents of force the material resources of this country, while also harnessing the use of those resources so that we, in the Americas, have equipment and training equal to the task of any emergency and defense.\n\nIn the long run, we must rebuild a world in which we can live, move, and conduct business in a democratic manner. As a result, the president has authorized an expansion of the military industry, including the construction of additional factories dedicated to producing military equipment for our armed forces."
 USA_An_Abrupt_Awakening: "An Abrupt Awakening"
 USA_An_Abrupt_Awakening_desc: "The war has begun. Despite President Willkie's promise to keep the US out of the war, such a blatant attack cannot be ignored, and the majority of the public supports him in this regard.\n\nHowever, we are unprepared for a war of this magnitude. President Willkie had not expected an attack so soon, and was more concerned with advancing his social and economic reforms than with rearmament. He frequently chastised Roosevelt for purposefully leading America into war, but now it appears he is the one leading the country into war. After all, Roosevelt was correct about one thing.\n\nWe must now devote our entire attention to rearmament and mobilization. Willkie's reforms will have to be postponed because there is a war to be won."
 USA_Coordinate_Our_Resources: "Coordinate Our Resources"
 USA_Coordinate_Our_Resources_desc: "Now that we are at war, we must coordinate our resources and funds with the other Allies and decide which branch of the armed forces we want to invest in and further research. Our allies have faith in us and will follow in our footsteps. This is the President's responsibility, and he must choose wisely, because it could give us and the rest of the Allies an advantage in either branch of the armed forces when it comes to new technology. We have the choice of investing in the army, navy, or air force."
 USA_Play_Catch_Up: "Play Catch Up"
 USA_Play_Catch_Up_desc: "We have a lot of ground to make up. Our military capabilities are deficient. More military equipment factories are needed to supply our armed forces, and we need them now. We've been sitting idle and oblivious for far too long, and it's finally caught up with us. The president has directed the construction of several new military factories in the hopes of having enough production to sustain our equipment usage in the near future.

We will, however, be unable to avoid the "toil and sweat."\n\nThis competition is not merely one of armaments. It is a competition of energy against energy, production against production, brains against brains, salesmanship against salesmanship. We should not be afraid to face it. History demonstrates that our way of life is the more powerful. It has produced more wealth, industry, happiness, and human enlightenment than any other source. The strongest men are those who are free.\n\nHowever, we cannot take this historical fact for granted. We must bring it to life. If we are to defeat totalitarian powers, we must embark on a new journey of adventure and discovery. We must broaden the human race's horizon. We must commit ourselves to a new way of life."

Person and property rights — civil liberties — that our forefathers fought for and that we still enjoy are nearly extinct in Europe.\n\nWe will guide our people along the path of sacrifice and service to their country. What we are doing is far harsher than we would like to do—far harsher than we would have done if the old world had not been swept away by war. We cannot rebuild our American democracy without hardship, sacrifice, and, yes, even suffering."
 USA_McNarys_Farm_Plan: "McNary's Farm Plan"
 USA_McNarys_Farm_Plan_desc: "Agriculture was something Willkie never paid enough attention to, despite McNary's repeated reminders and advice to do so. Farmers are among the most important people in our country, especially during times of war. They are the people who feed our citizens and soldiers, yet they are frequently overlooked or taken for granted.\n\nMcNary has had enough experience with agricultural issues as a Senator to know that he will not make the same mistake again. Now that he is president, he can help these people more effectively and provide them with the government assistance they desperately require. There is no hope of victory when the fields and forests are empty and 130,000,000 people are starving."

A man with a grand vision for America, one in which every man is equal in both rights and opportunities, regardless of race, wealth, or social standing. A vision he will never see realized, his reforms and plans for America unfinished.\n\nWhile the entire country mourns the loss of their leader and a great man, McNary, the former vice-president, must now assume the presidency and successfully lead his people through this crisis and the ongoing war.

For the first time in history, someone advanced from Secretary of State to President in a single term.\n\nBecause both the president and the vice president died while in office, leaving both positions vacant, and the former Secretary of State was named vice president by McNary, the former Secretary of State is now the president under the Presidential Succession Act of 1886.\n\nDuring all of this crisis and chaos, the new president must now decide whether or not to continue the war."

Germany is taking over Europe, and Japan is doing whatever they want in Asia. Their unprovoked assault on us will not be tolerated.\n\nThe Allies require our assistance in defending democracy and liberty around the world, which the Axis wishes to extinguish. If we do not put an end to their warmongering and conquest now, this is as much our end as it is that of the Allies.

 USA_The_Military_Industrial_Complex: "The Military Industrial Complex"
 USA_The_Military_Industrial_Complex_desc: "Even though we are at war, our government has only relied on civilian industries since 1797. Throughout the Great War, the government owned its own shipyards and weapons manufacturing facilities, on which we relied. However, a massive shift in the way the American government arms the military is now required.\n\nThe president has now formed the War Production Board to coordinate civilian industries and transition them to wartime production. Several American corporations, including Boeing and General Motors, will keep and expand their defense divisions. These companies will begin to develop various technologies that will benefit both our military and civilian lives, as well as begin manufacturing and supplying our military forces."

 USA_Enlarge_the_Research_Budget-desc: "Because our economy is rapidly expanding and growing, we can afford to increase the budget for war research. It makes sense to increase the budget for researching new military technologies as quick as possible, as the war appears to be lasting longer than first anticipated.\n\nThis is an important step toward giving us an advantage over our adversaries, because the better our technology, the faster this war will be over and fewer lives will be lost. Technology will be a major deciding factor in who wins this conflict, so let's make sure we don't fall behind in that department."

 USA_A_Necessary_Evil_desc: "Japanese Americans, along with German and Italian Americans, are currently one of our country's greatest security threats. The Pacific Coast, where over 100,000 Japanese Americans live, is particularly affected. Measures must be taken as soon as possible to identify and then deport, relocate, and imprison as many of them as possible.\n\nWe will establish military exclusion zones and begin identifying potential incarceration sites for these enemy aliens. This is not something we can be proud of, but it is a necessary evil in order to protect our country."

 USA_Complete_Mobilization_desc: "The War Production Board coordinates the nation's productive capabilities in order to meet military priorities. Many military orders are filled by converted consumer-products plants. Automobile manufacturers are producing tanks and aircraft, transforming the United States into an arsenal of democracy.\n\nMillions of women have entered the manufacturing and production industries; the majority are newly created temporary jobs in munitions, and some are replacing men who are serving in the military. For the first time in what feels like an eternity, the United States is back on the world stage, ready to carry the torch of liberty and freedom once more."
 USA_A_Return_to_Isolation: "A Return to Isolation"
 USA_A_Return_to_Isolation_desc: "The people have spoken, and their voices have been heard. President Willkie has promised to keep the United States out of the war. This was one of the promises he failed to keep, so President Taft will keep it for him. Taft has effectively navigated the United States out of this unnecessary and costly war by ordering the immediate withdrawal of all troops from foreign soil. Our soldiers will soon return home to their wives and children, and the people will hail Taft as a hero for sparing them much pain and death."
 USA_Assure_the_People: "Assure the People"
 USA_Assure_the_People_desc: "We are aware that many people are skeptical of us leaving the war and returning to peace. They regard us as cowards for abandoning the Allies. President Taft will address the nation and deliver a speech in which he will explain why this was the only way to save the United States from certain annihilation. People will understand, they must understand, that we must prioritize domestic issues over foreign wars if we are to ever have prosperity and stability in our country again. People need to believe in their president now more than ever before, and Taft will reassure them that everything is under control."

 USA_Tear_Up_the_New_Deal_desc: "The inefficiency and waste of many New Deal programs must end immediately. The failure to allow private enterprise and businesses to restore the nation's economy, rather than relying on government programs to end the Great Depression, is destroying our economy and our great country.\n\nThe New Deal was merely a disguise for socialism, and the deficit spending, high farm subsidies, governmental bureaucracy, the National Labor Relations Board, and nationalized health insurance are preventing us from truly prospering.\n\nBeginning today, Taft will begin undoing the damage Roosevelt and the other fools have done to this country with their shoddy economic policies and welfare programs, putting an end to the New Deal nonsense for good. After the damage has been repaired, Taft will be able to implement his own economic reforms without all of the unnecessary and excessive government spending."

 USA_Consolidate_the_Conservative_Coalition_desc: "During Roosevelt's presidency in 1938, Taft worked with the Conservative Coalition, which included Conservative Democrats and Conservative Republicans, to halt the expansion of the New Deal. However, the Conservative Republicans, and Taft personally, frequently clashed with the moderate Republicans led by Thomas E. Dewey for control of the party. Taft can now consolidate the Conservative Coalition and wrest control from Dewey, finally defeating the Moderate Republicans and gaining control of the party in the name of the Conservatives."
 USA_Tax_Cuts_For_Businesses: "Tax Cuts for Businesses"
 USA_Tax_Cuts_For_Businesses_desc: "Now that most of the damage the New Deal has caused has been undone, President Taft is presenting a conservative domestic program that promotes limited government spending, a balanced federal budget, low taxes, pro-business policies to spur economic growth, a limited number of social welfare programs such as Social Security, a minimum wage, public housing, and federal aid to public education, and an adequate national defense centered on strengthening the Navy and Air Force.\n\nThe implementation of several pro-business policies, such as lower business taxes, is the first step in this new program. Tax cuts for businesses will be implemented immediately in the hopes of accelerating recovery and economic growth."
 USA_Weaken_the_National_Labor_Relations_Board: "Weaken the National Labor Relations Board"
 USA_Weaken_the_National_Labor_Relations_Board_desc: "The National Labor Relations Board is a disgrace and a blight on our country, an organization that will go to any length to advance its socialist agenda, even if it means harming our economy and people. It was established by Roosevelt in 1934, and it, like its predecessor, the National Labor Board, has proven ineffective since then.\n\nWithin a year, the "First NLRB" had lost most of its jurisdiction. Its decisions in the automobile, newspaper, textile, and steel industries were so contentious that Roosevelt frequently removed them from the board's jurisdiction. Previous investigations resulted in allegations of communist influence within the agency, which were proven to be true in at least one case.\n\nPresident Taft is proposing an Anti-Union bill which will prohibit the NLRB from engaging in any form of mediation or conciliation, while also limiting overall Union activity and power."

 USA_For_the_Good_of_the_Nation_desc: "Thanks to President Taft, we can finally return to normalcy and get back to business, attempting to stabilize the shaky government and navigating through this leadership crisis. We now have the time and resources to focus on domestic issues, rather than sending our people to die in some foreign country for a lost cause. The Allies may fall, and we must leave them to their fate, but the United States is on the road to peace, stability, and prosperity, thanks to President Taft! Sacrifices must be made for the good of the nation."

The war may last longer than we would like, but we are now prepared and capable of sustaining a war of this length and magnitude.

We can sit back while the rest of the world sends their people to die and depletes their resources. Because of President Taft's decision to return to isolation, the United States can regain its stability, and we now have the time and resources to address all of our pressing domestic issues. When the dust of the war settles and the other nations have destroyed themselves, the United States will be as strong and prosperous as it has never been, ready to tackle any issue and fight any foe who sets their sights on us."

Most observers can tell Roosevelt is tired because of his weight loss and haggard appearance.\n\nHowever, once the campaign got underway, Roosevelt demonstrated enough passion and tenacity to allay most fears and deflect Republican attacks. With the war still raging, he warned voters not to "change horses in the middle of the race." Labor unions, which had grown rapidly during the war, backed Roosevelt wholeheartedly. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman easily won the 1944 election, defeating Dewey and his running mate John W. Bricker.\n\nBecause the president campaigned for a strong United Nations, his victory represents support for the country's future participation in the international community."

If we pass that test successfully and honorably, we will have performed a historic service that men, women, and children will remember for the rest of their lives.\n\nToday, in this year of war, we have learned lessons at a high cost, and we will benefit from them. We've learned that we can't live in peace on our own; that our own well-being is dependent on the well-being of other countries far away. We've learned that we must live like men, not ostriches or dogs in a manger. We've learned to be global citizens, members of the human family. We've discovered the simple truth that, as Emerson put it, "the only way to have a friend is to be one." We will not achieve lasting peace if we approach it with suspicion, mistrust, or fear."

President Roosevelt has proposed legislation to renew the Lend-Lease program, which is expected to pass quickly through both the House and Senate.\n\nDuring the Tehran Conference, Joseph Stalin even acknowledged publicly the importance of American efforts during a conference dinner.

The most pressing need of our time is for men to learn to coexist in peace and harmony.\n\nThe world's peoples face a future fraught with uncertainty, a mix of great hopes and great fears. In this time of uncertainty, they look to the United States for good will, strength, and wise leadership like never before. It is therefore fitting that we use this occasion to proclaim to the world the fundamental principles of the faith by which we live, as well as to declare our goals to all peoples.\n\nThe American people remain steadfast in the faith that has inspired this country since its inception. We believe that all men have the right to equal legal justice and the opportunity to participate in the common good. We believe that every man has the right to free thought and expression. We believe that because they are made in the image of God, all men are created equal. From this faith we will not be moved."

Their economic situation is rudimentary and stagnant. Their poverty is a disadvantage and a threat to both them and more prosperous areas. For the first time in history, humanity possesses the knowledge and skill to alleviate these people's suffering.\n\nWe should make the benefits of our store of technical knowledge available to peace-loving peoples in order to assist them in realizing their aspirations for a better life. We invite other countries to join us in this endeavor by pooling their technological resources. Their contributions will be greatly appreciated. This should be a cooperative endeavor however, in which all nations collaborate whenever possible through the United Nations and its specialized agencies. It must be a global effort to achieve peace, plenty, and freedom.\n\nOur plans do not include the old imperialism of exploitation for foreign profit.

 USA_The_Truman_Doctrine: "The Truman Doctrine"
 USA_The_Truman_Doctrine_desc: "The Truman Doctrine is a foreign policy commitment by the United States to "support democracies against authoritarian threats." The doctrine was developed with the primary goal of limiting Soviet geopolitical expansion in mind. President Harry S. Truman announced it to Congress. More broadly, the Truman Doctrine implies American support for other countries perceived to be under threat from Marxism-Leninism.\n\n"It must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures," Truman told Congress. Truman contends that because totalitarian regimes coerce free peoples, they automatically pose a threat to international peace and the United States' national security.\n\nThe reaction to Truman's announcement has been mostly positive, with a few dissenters. Truman's doctrine is supported by anti-communists in both parties."
 USA_Cordial_But_Not_Friendly_Relations: "Cordial, But Not Friendly Relations"
 USA_Cordial_But_Not_Friendly_Relations_desc: "We must tread carefully with the recently announced Truman doctrine. We cannot afford to make enemies and launch another war at a time when we should be focusing on rebuilding and restoring stability and prosperity.\n\nAs a result, rather than publicly condemning and undermining powers such as the Soviet Union, we should maintain cordial relations with them. Another war so soon, and with a power like the Soviet Union, would be disastrous, especially since our people are exhausted from the long war and simply want peace.\n\nWe will implement the Truman doctrine, but in a prudent and circumspect manner so as not to irritate the bear and risk another World War."

One way of life is based upon the will of the majority, and is distinguished by free institutions, representative government, free elections, guarantees of individual liberty, freedom of speech and religion, and freedom from political oppression.\n\nThe second way of life is based upon the will of a minority forcibly imposed upon the majority. It relies upon terror and oppression, a controlled press and radio; fixed elections, and the suppression of personal freedoms.\n\nWe must assist free peoples to work out their own destinies in their own way. Our help should be primarily through economic and financial aid which is essential to economic stability and orderly political processes."

The United States will transferred billions of dollars in economic recovery programs to Western European economies.\n\nThe goals of this plan are to rebuild war-torn regions, remove trade barriers, modernize industry, improve European prosperity and prevent the spread of communism. The Marshall Plan proposes the reduction of interstate barriers and the economic integration of the European Continent while also encouraging an increase in productivity as well as the adoption of modern business procedures.\n\nThe Marshall Plan aid is divided among the participant states roughly on a per capita basis. A larger amount will be given to the major industrial powers, as the prevailing opinion is that their resuscitation is essential for the general European revival. Somewhat more aid per capita will also be directed toward the Allied nations, with less for those that had been part of the Axis or remained neutral. The largest recipients of Marshall Plan money will be the United Kingdom, France and West Germany."

Let us not forget the sorrow and heartache that exist today in the homes of so many of our neighbors — neighbors whose most valuable possession has been sacrificed to redeem our liberty.\n\nOnly through work—constant devotion to the responsibilities that lie ahead of us—can we repay the debt we owe to our God, our dead, and our children. We must work to heal the wounds of a suffering world—to build a lasting peace based on justice and the rule of law. We can only achieve such a peace through hard, laborious, and painstaking work—by understanding and cooperating with our allies in peace as we have in war."
 USA_Rebuild_the_Destroyed_Enemy: "Rebuild the Destroyed Enemy"
 USA_Rebuild_the_Destroyed_Enemy_desc: "In recent months, it has become clear that the visible destruction was probably less severe than the disruption of the entire fabric of the European economy. All aspects of national economies were engulfed by the feverish preparation for war and the even more feverish maintenance of the war effort. Machinery has deteriorated or is completely obsolete.\n\nThe truth is that Europe's requirements for foreign food and other essential products - primarily from America - for the next three or four years are so much greater than her current ability to pay that she requires substantial additional assistance or faces severe economic, social, and political deterioration.\n\nAn understanding of the nature of the problem and the remedies to be used is an essential component of any successful action on the part of the United States. Political zeal and prejudice should be avoided. The difficulties we have outlined can and will be overcome with foresight and a willingness on the part of our people to face up to the vast responsibility that history has clearly placed upon our country."

 USA_Stabilize_the_Occupied_Economy_desc: "The solution lies in breaking the vicious circle and restoring European citizens' faith in the economic future of their home countries and Europe as a whole. Manufacturers and farmers across large areas must be able and willing to exchange their products for currencies whose continuing value is unquestionable.\n\nIt is logical that the United States should do everything in its power to help the world return to normal economic health, without which there can be no political stability or guaranteed peace. Our policy is aimed not at any particular country or doctrine, but at hunger, poverty, desperation, and chaos. Its goal should be to restore the world's working economy in order to allow the emergence of political and social conditions conducive to the existence of free institutions. Such assistance cannot be provided piecemeal as various crises emerge.Any future assistance provided by this government should be curative rather than palliative. Any government willing to assist in the recovery effort will receive full cooperation from the United States Government."

The Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal is made up of judges, prosecutors, and staff from eleven countries that fought Japan: Australia, Canada, China, France, India, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the Philippines, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States; the defense is made up of Japanese and American attorneys.\n\nThe court will try 28 high-ranking Japanese military and political leaders, including current and former prime ministers, foreign ministers, and military commanders.

Long-standing commercial ties, private institutions, banks, insurance companies, and shipping companies vanished due to capital loss, nationalization, or simple destruction. The confidence in the local currency has been severely shaken in many countries. During the war, Europe's business structure was completely destroyed.\n\nAllied occupational authorities have to vigorously pursue a military disarmament program in Germany, partly by removal of equipment but mainly through an import embargo on raw materials. Economic recovery in Europe can not go forward without the reconstruction of the German industrial base.\n\nThe first "level of industry" plan, states that German heavy industry is to be lowered to 50% of its 1938 levels by the destruction of 1,500 listed manufacturing plants. The Allied Control Council is setting the foundation of the future German economy by putting a cap on German steel production capacity, equivalent to 25% of the pre-war production level. Steel plants thus made redundant are to be dismantled. Progress will be made in converting Germany to an agricultural and light industry economy."

After the Supreme Court ruled in United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Association that the federal government could regulate insurance companies under the authority of the Commerce Clause in the United States Constitution and that federal antitrust laws applied to the insurance industry, the 79th Congress has passed the McCarran-Ferguson Act.\n\nThe McCarran-Ferguson Act does not regulate insurance and does not require states to regulate insurance. It states that "Acts of Congress" that do not expressly purport to regulate the "business of insurance" will not pre-empt state laws or regulations that do.\n\nIn particular, it exempts the "business of insurance" from federal antitrust laws as long as the state regulates in that area, with the proviso that cases of boycott, coercion, and intimidation remain prohibited regardless of state regulation. In contrast, most other federal laws will not apply to insurance regardless of whether states regulate it or not."

The Bretton Woods system requires countries to guarantee currency convertibility into US dollars. It also envisions increased international cooperation to prevent future competitive devaluations, and thus establishes the International Monetary Fund to monitor exchange rates and lend reserve currencies to countries with balance of payments deficits.\n\nMost recently, the Bretton Woods Agreements Act, which was passed by Parliament, ensures UK government funding for the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of the United Nations from the consolidated fund."

During the war, the government promoted unions, and they attempted to cement their gains through large-scale strikes in major industries. Meanwhile, price controls are gradually being phased out, and inflation is skyrocketing.\n\nWe must do everything in our power to ensure the labor unions' continued support and strength, which the Republicans intend to erode.

It was passed over President Harry S. Truman's veto by the 80th United States Congress.\n\nTaft-Hartley was enacted in response to a recent major strike wave. Despite the fact that it was passed by the Republican-controlled 80th Congress, the law has received widespread support from congressional Democrats, many of whom voted with their Republican colleagues to override Truman's veto.\n\nThe Taft-Hartley Act amends the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, prohibiting unions from engaging in a number of unfair labor practices. Jurisdictional strikes, wildcat strikes, solidarity or political strikes, secondary boycotts, secondary and mass picketing, closed shops, and monetary donations by unions to federal political campaigns are all prohibited by the Taft-Hartley Act. The amendments also allow states to pass right-to-work legislation that prohibits union shops. Union officers are also required by law to sign non-communist affidavits with the government."

This policy will be implemented as soon as possible, taking into account the time required to implement any necessary changes without jeopardizing efficiency or morale. The order also creates a committee to investigate and make recommendations to the military's civilian leadership on how to implement the policy.\n\nThis is a watershed moment in the post-war civil rights movement, as well as a major accomplishment of Truman's presidency."

As a result, President Willkie has decided to remove long-serving Secretary of State Cordell Hull from his position and is currently seeking a suitable replacement.\n\nThe first candidate is Harold Stassen, the liberal Republican governor of Minnesota. He is popular among Democrats and Farmer-Laborers, and some Republicans have proposed him for Secretary of State. However, he is unpopular among more conservative Republicans, such as Robert Taft.\n\nThe second option is Henry Luce, a Republican Party member and magazine magnate who has been called "the most influential private citizen in the America of his day". He founded and oversees a magazine empire that has transformed journalism and the reading habits of millions of Americans.\n\nRaymond E. Baldwin, the current governor of Connecticut and a conservative Republican, is the third option. He is an early supporter of Willkie, and he ensured that the Connecticut delegation at the 1940 Republican Convention backed Willkie, which was critical in defeating the other frontrunners.\n\nFinally, Robert A. Taft, Senator and leader of the conservative coalition of Republicans and conservative Democrats who prevented the New Deal from being expanded, would be an appropriate replacement. Taft, a staunch non-interventionist, believes that America should avoid involvement in European or Asian wars and instead focus on domestic issues."

 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.1.t: "The Preparation Measures Act"
 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.1.d: "President Willkie has proposed the Preparation Measures Act, which would allow the United States to rearm in order to be better prepared for war. Although we remain neutral for the time being, Willkie favors greater US involvement in the war to support Britain and other Allies, which means that the US may soon play a larger role and assume more responsibilities in this war.\n\nWillkie frequently discusses the threat to America and the need to assist Britain and other Allies, and passage of this bill will allow us to do just that."
 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.1.A: "The Giant wakes... soon."

 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.2.t: "The Wartime Agriculture Bill"
 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.2.d: "McNary has always been interested in agricultural and forestry issues, having chaired the Irrigation and Reclamation of Arid Lands Committee and served on the Agriculture and Forestry Committee.\n\nSimilar to Roosevelt's Agricultural Adjustment Act, McNary's Wartime Agriculture Bill is intended to boost agricultural prices by reducing surpluses and subsidising. Unlike the Agricultural Adjustment Act, the bill will not favour large farmers and food processors over small farmers and sharecroppers, but will instead aim to provide equal benefits to both."
 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.2.A: "We can't forget the people who feed us."

 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.3.t: "Internment Camps"
 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.3.d: "Not long ago the president authorised Executive Order 9066, which allows regional military commanders to designate "military areas" from which "any or all persons may be excluded". This authority is being used to declare that all people of Japanese ancestry must leave Alaska, as well as the military exclusion zones that cover all of California and parts of Oregon, Washington, and Arizona.\n\nPresidential Proclamations 2525, 2526, and 2527 were issued pursuant to the Alien Enemies Act, designating Japanese, German, and Italian nationals as enemy aliens. US officials have used information gathered over the previous decade to locate and imprison thousands of Japanese-American community leaders.\n\nThose who are as little as 1/16 Japanese are being placed in internment camps, with the United States Census Bureau assisting incarceration efforts by providing specific individual census data on Japanese Americans. These measures are designed to reduce the security risk that Japanese Americans are thought to pose."
 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.3.A: "If they have one drop of Japanese blood in them, they must go to camp."

 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.4.t: "The Capitol's Heart"
 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.4.d: "If there is one positive outcome from Willkie's untimely death, it is that Democrats and Republicans are more united and working together more than ever before. McNary has the full backing and support of both Democrats and Republicans, as both sides simply want to ensure that the remainder of the term goes smoothly so that the country is not further destabilised.\n\nEveryone can agree that, following the initial shock of Willkie's death, the public needs to be reassured that the government is prepared and capable of dealing with this crisis. McNary now has the opportunity to pass much-needed bills and reforms while finishing the term."
 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.4.A: "We need to be united now more than ever."

 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.5.t: "Total Mobilization Achieved"
 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.5.d: "We are prepared. The factories are producing military equipment around the clock, and the public is on our side and more optimistic than ever. The troops are prepared, marching, training, and eager to fight. The dockyards are constructing a fleet capable of competing with both Japan and Britain. The airports are packed with planes, and only the best pilots are in command.\n\nAfter a long period of time, rearmament is finally complete, and we are as powerful as we have never been. The Japanese lapdogs and the Axis will now feel the full force of American military power descending on them.\n\nThe righteous might of the American people will carry them to victory. We will not only defend ourselves to the fullest extent possible, but we will also ensure that this type of treachery never happens again. There can be no doubt that our people, territory, and interests are in grave danger. With faith in our armed forces and the unwavering determination of our people, we will achieve the unavoidable victory, so help us God."
 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.5.A: "The Giant Wakes."

 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.6.t: "Sidelining Dewey"
 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.6.d: "For far too long, Thomas E. Dewey, a New York District Attorney who became nationally famous for successfully prosecuting several prominent organized-crime figures, and more importantly, the leader of moderate Republicans, has been a thorn in Taft's side. Dewey's principles are not conservative or consistent enough for the Republican Party. He lacks the courage to stand up to the mob that wants to smear any Republican who speaks out against the New Deal. There is only one way to defeat the New Deal: face it head on. You can't out-deal them.\n\nDewey is arrogant and bossy, and his advisers will persuade him to pursue too much internationalism. He is from New York, and he considers the group opinions there to be far more important than they are. With the government still in disarray and Taft as president, he now has the power he needs to marginalise Dewey and his moderate faction, preventing them from playing a larger role or having much influence in politics."
 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.6.A: "Conservatism is the only way forward."

 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.7.t: "An Anti-Union Bill"
 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.7.d: "President Taft proposes a new bill that would limit labour union activities and power. The bill makes it illegal for unions to engage in a number of unfair labour practises. Jurisdictional strikes, wildcat strikes, solidarity or political strikes, secondary boycotts, secondary and mass picketing, closed shops, and monetary donations by unions to federal political campaigns are among the practises prohibited by the bill.\n\nThe bill also allows states to pass right-to-work legislation that prohibits union shops and requires union officers to sign non-communist affidavits with the government. Furthermore, if an impending or ongoing strike jeopardised national health or safety, the executive branch of the federal government can obtain legal strikebreaking injunctions."
 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.7.A: "Unions need to be kept in check."

 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.8.t: "Allied Research Initiative"
 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.8.d: "President Willkie has been given the opportunity to coordinate allied resources in order to fund new research in a field of warfare that had previously been neglected due to a lack of focus on rearmament. This research will benefit not only the United States, but all of the Allies as a whole, so it should be thoroughly considered.\n\nThree options have emerged as the most promising investments: We have the option of investing in new submarine technology, infantry weapons, or fighter planes. Whatever we decide, the Allies will undoubtedly benefit greatly from this."
 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.8.A: "Submarines."
 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.8.B: "Infantry weapons."
 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.8.C: "Fighter planes."

 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.9.t: "A Shiny Pack of Wolves"
 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.9.d: "Even though the Axis cannot yet compete with Allied naval forces, it is critical that we keep it that way and do not become complacent, lest they beat us at sea as well. Our research into new submarine technology will ensure that the Allies maintain their lead on the waves and stay one step ahead of the Axis.\n\nOur investment in submarine research has now paid off, and we will soon be able to produce more and better infantry weapons to supply these men. Furthermore, we can share our research with the other Allies so that they also can begin producing better submarines as soon as possible."
 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.9.A: "The Allies rule the waves."

 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.10.t: "A Soldier's New Best Friend"
 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.10.d: "Small arms began to be shared shortly after the start of the war, with most of the 'sharing' being one-sided because we are not yet directly involved in the conflict, and thus all movement is from the US to the UK. Now, as British manufacturers work to replace the equipment lost by the British Army, the British government is looking overseas for additional sources of equipment to help overcome shortages and prepare for future offensives. The most extreme example of the shortages can be found in the hastily assembled Local Defence Volunteers, who are forced to train with broom handles and makeshift pikes made from lengths of piping and old bayonets until proper weapons can be provided.\n\nOur investment in infantry weapons research has now paid off, and we will soon be able to produce more and better infantry weapons to supply these men. Furthermore, we can share our research with the other Allies so that they also can begin producing better infantry weapons as soon as possible."
 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.10.A: "We can always use more guns."

 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.11.t: "The Edge in the Air"
 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.11.d: "Since the beginning of the war, we have supplied several aircraft types to both the Royal Navy and the RAF. However, in comparison to the Axis air force, it does not appear to be sufficient. But now we have a chance to turn the tide of the air battle in favor of the Allies.\n\nOur investment in fighter plane research has now paid off, and we will soon be able to produce more and better fighter planes to supply the Allies. Furthermore, we can share our research with the other Allies so that they also can begin producing better fighter planes as soon as possible."
 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.11.A: "The power of an air force is terrific when there is nothing to oppose it."

 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.12.t: "Another President, Another Direction"
 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.12.d: "The entire country is in disbelief. Never before in American history have both the President and Vice President died while in office, leaving both positions vacant. The government is in disarray, chaotic, and scrambling, and the public is terrified after losing two of their leaders and their hope alongside them.\n\nAccording to the Presidential Succession Act of 1886, for the first time in history, the former Secretary of State will serve as president until the end of the term. The new president must now decide whether to continue the ongoing war. With a weak government and a despondent and fearful public, it may be best to call it quits before too much damage is done."
 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.12.A: "We keep fighting, for liberty and freedom!"
 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.12.B: "Pull all forces back immediately, this is not worth it."

 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.13.t: "The United States Has Left the War!"
 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.13.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]US President Robert A. Taft announced today to the world that the US will withdraw all of its forces from foreign countries and leave the war immediately. Rearmament efforts will be halted as soon as possible, and the country will return to isolation.\n\nTaft, a staunch non-interventionist, believes that America should avoid involvement in European or Asian wars and instead focus on domestic issues. He believes that a strong military, combined with the natural geographic protection provided by the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, will be sufficient to protect America even if Germany takes over all of Europe.\n\nWith Japan now almost uncontested in Asia, free to do as they please, and the Allies losing a major power that could have turned the tide of the war in their favour, this turn of events has surely been a blessing to the Axis.\n\nWill the Allies be able to win this war without the US, or is this the final nail in their coffin?"
 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.13.A: "We have bigger problems."
 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.13.B: "We'll come for you later."
 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.13.C: "How can they abandon us?"
 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.13.D: "What? Why? How?"

 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.14.t: "Rally in Seattle"
 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.14.d: ""When the Roosevelt administration came to power, we heard a lot from the forgotten man. The Government, we were told, must care for those who had no other means of support. With this proposition all of us agreed. And we still hold firmly to the principle that those whom private industry cannot support must be supported by government agency, whether federal or state.\n\nThe New Deal has diverted the money of the rich from productive enterprises to government bonds, so that the United States treasury — and no one else — may have plenty to spend. We must — and can — raise more money at less relative cost to the people. We must do it without inflicting on the poor the present disproportionate load of hidden taxes.\n\nThe New Deal's attack on business has had inevitable results. The investor has been afraid to invest his capital, and therefore billions of dollars now lie idle in the banks. The businessman has been afraid to expand his operations, and therefore millions of men have been turned away from the employment offices. Low incomes in the cities, and irresponsible experiments in the country, have deprived the farmer of his markets.\n\nAnd unless we do something about it soon, 130,000,000 people—an entire nation—will become victims, because they stand in need of a defense system which the former administration has proved itself powerless to create anywhere except on paper.\n\nThe New Deal stands for doing what has to be done by spending as much money as possible. I propose to do it by spending as little money as possible.""
 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.14.A: "The crowd cheered."

 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.15.t: "President Taft Addresses the Nation!"
 USA_1940_1944_Wilkie.15.d: ""I am going to assume that the great majority of people are in favor of aid to England and the Allies. I am also going to assume that a great majority are in favor of us returning to peace. The two sentiments are not entirely consistent, and yet they both exist. If the last election was a mandate for aid to England and the Allies, because Mr. Willkie declared in favor of it, it was also a mandate for keeping the United States out of war, for Willkie declared unequivocally his determination to keep the United States out of war. The people of the country have the right to assume, and did assume, that whoever was elected, we would remain at peace. With both the president and the vice-president's sudden deaths, this responsibility falls to me.\n\nI see no way in which England can bring the war to a satisfactory peace, except by developing an air force equal to that of Germany, able to do to the German factories and cities what the Germans have been doing to the English factories and cities. It is tragic that while we talked about aid to England and air planes for ourselves, no really effective step was taken to develop the necessary factories.\n\nIt is universally agreed that we need a two-ocean navy. Today we haven't even a one-ocean navy. I would regard it as a violation of my duties as acting president to authorize to deplete that navy further at the present time. In spite of all we may do, England and the Allies may collapse, and we may face a serious threat from Europe or from Asia. When that threat comes knocking at our door, we need to be prepared.""

 USA_Wilkie_Dead.1.t: "President Wilkie Dead!"
 USA_Wilkie_Dead.1.d: "Willkie was sitting in his office, nervously tapping his foot and flipping through some documents. But he couldn't seem to concentrate. He was feeling the effects of his stress. He stood up after taking a large sip from his whisky glass.\n\nFor a while, he walked up and down his office, thinking. He was tired and depleted of energy. Doctors advised him to take it easy after his last heart attack and to stop drinking and smoking. As President of the United States, how are you supposed to "take it easy"?\n\nThe temperature in the room was dropping by the minute. He'll have to call his secretary right away and tell her to turn up the heat in the room. He took a cigarette from his table and lit it, but felt a sharp pain in his left arm as he took the first drag. Even though he dreaded going to the hospital, he'll have to tell his doctor about it the next time they meet.\n\nHis breathing changed abruptly. Suddenly he couldn't breathe properly anymore; it felt like something was pressing on his chest. Something is wrong here; this is not normal. Before he could pick up the phone to call for help, he collapsed to the ground."
 USA_Wilkie_Dead.1.A: "Cause of death: heart attack."

 USA_McNary_Dead.1.t: "President McNary Dead!"
 USA_McNary_Dead.1.d: "McNary sat across from the Secretary of State in a dimly lit meeting room. It was late at night, but Willkie's' sudden death had left a lot of work for both of them, especially now that McNary was President. It had come as a surprise, but he was prepared for his newfound responsibilities.\n\nBoth he and the Secretary of State noticed that his speech was beginning to slur. He had these kind of problems a couple of times over the past few weeks, but he neglected going to the doctors because of all the work. He was most likely just tired, as he hadn't slept properly in days. They carried on as usual, with the President now listening more than talking.\n\nMcNary became unable to concentrate as time passed. Everything he heard he forgot in a matter of seconds, and he couldn't form a coherent thought. He had a headache in the back of his head that was gradually getting worse. It had gotten to the point where the pain was unbearable. At this point, his Secretary of State had also noticed and was asking him if everything was okay.\n\nMcNary collapsed before he could respond, his head slamming into the meeting table."

 USA_FDR_Dead.1.t: "An Unfinished Portrait"
 USA_FDR_Dead.1.d: "Roosevelt was completely exhausted. Over the last few years, he had noticed a rapid decline in his physical health. All of the stress and duties that come with being President have taken their toll on the man. Being the only President in history to serve four consecutive terms, and having to lead his country through a war that spanned the entire globe, his burden was massive and incomparable to any president before him.\n\nHe had time to reflect and consider his situation now that he was sitting on a chair and told not to move. His appointment with Elizabeth Shoumatoff to have a portrait painted of him was a welcome distraction. He is concerned that they will no longer be able to keep his deteriorating health a secret from the public, and that once word gets out, there will be widespread panic and questioning of his fitness for the presidency. The people needed to have faith and be united now more than ever.Something felt strange. His thoughts were interrupted by a pain in the back of his head that seemed to get worse with time. It wasn't long before the pain became unbearable, and he had to speak up so that a doctor could examine him."

 USA_FDR_Dead.2.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]President of the United States Franklin Delano Roosevelt died unexpectedly yesterday afternoon at the age of 63, sending shockwaves around the world, having recently been inaugurated for a fourth term, which is unprecedented in the history of the United States. Vice President Harry S. Truman will now assume the presidency.\n\nRoosevelt collapsed unconscious in his chair while sitting for a portrait and was carried into his bedroom. Howard Bruenn, the president's attending cardiologist, diagnosed the medical emergency as a massive intracerebral haemorrhage.\n\nRoosevelt's body was placed in a flag-draped coffin and loaded onto the presidential train for the journey back to Washington this morning. Thousands of people flock to the tracks along the route to pay their respects. Following a White House funeral in a few days, Roosevelt will be transported to his birthplace at Hyde Park, and then buried in the rose garden of his Springwood estate, as he requested.\n\nRoosevelt was widely regarded as one of the most important figures in American history, as well as one of the most influential figures of the twentieth century, with some comparing him to Abraham Lincoln and George Washington for leading the country through the Great Depression and the war to a prosperous future."
