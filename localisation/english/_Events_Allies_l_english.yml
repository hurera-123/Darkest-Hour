 Yalta_Conference.1.t: "The Soviets Invite Us to Yalta"
 Yalta_Conference.1.d: "Respected President [USA.GetLeader],\n\nFirst and foremost, please accept my heartfelt gratitude on behalf of the Soviet people for your efforts in combating Nazi Germany's tyranny. We understand and appreciate your support, and we hope that this collaboration will last long after this bloody war is over.\n\nSecond, in light of the current European war situation, with the German war machine gradually crumbling and the tide of the war turning in our favour, I would like to personally invite you to a conference in the lovely Soviet city of Yalta. We hope to discuss the fate of postwar Europe at this conference. \n\nThird, I would like to assure you that the Soviet Government intends to maintain friendly relations with the Western Powers even after the war. Many rumours of Soviet hostility are circulating, and I would like to ensure that these false accusations do not taint the conference discussions.\n\nI sincerely hope that you will choose to attend the conference so that we can ensure that Europe once again enjoys peace and stability.\n\nVery truly yours,\n[SOV.GetLeader]."
 Yalta_Conference.1.A: "Of course! We will attend this conference!"
 
 Yalta_Conference.2.t: "The Soviets Invite Us to Yalta"
 Yalta_Conference.2.d: "Respected Prime Minister [ENG.GetLeader],\n\nFirst, let me congratulate you on your outstanding leadership of your country during this period of conflict with the German fascists. Such leadership was desperately needed for your country, and you have ensured that your country emerges from this war in a better position than it was before.\n\nSecond, in light of the current European war situation, with the German war machine gradually crumbling and the tide of the war turning in our favour, I would like to personally invite you to a conference in the lovely Soviet city of Yalta. We hope to discuss the fate of postwar Europe at this conference.\n\nThird, I would like to assure you that the Soviet Government intends to maintain friendly relations with the Western Powers even after the war. Many rumours of Soviet hostility are circulating, and I would like to ensure that these false accusations do not taint the conference discussions.\n\nI sincerely hope that you will choose to attend the conference so that we can ensure that Europe once again enjoys peace and stability.\n\nVery truly yours,\n[SOV.GetLeader]."
 Yalta_Conference.2.A: "Of course! We will attend this conference!"
 
 Yalta_Conference.3.t: "The Yalta Conference Begins"
 Yalta_Conference.3.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]President [USA.GetLeader] and Prime Minister [UK.GetLeader] have decided to attend a conference in the Soviet city of Yalta, following a personal invitation from [SOV.GetLeader]. The invitation reportedly came after [SOV.GetLeader] deemed the war situation in Europe "sufficiently favourable."\n\nAlthough official details of the conference have yet to be revealed, sources within the Allied Governments have hinted that it may decide the fate of post-war Europe. If these rumours are true, it would imply that the Allied leaders are confident of defeating Nazism and intend to reshape Europe in their image.\n\nWhile the official reaction of [GER.GetNameDef] has been muted thus far, Joseph Gobbels, the Nazi Minister of Propaganda, has been reported to be outraged by this turn of events, calling it "a sham" and "a victory dance of idiots who haven't even attained victory yet."\n\nThe news of the Conference's start has elicited a range of reactions from around the world. While some have labelled the Western powers "hypocrites" for "striking a deal with one tyrant in order to defeat another", others have referred to the conference as "the first step toward re-establishing a peaceful and stable Europe."\n\nIt is no secret that many people in the Western and Soviet governments despise each other. While the war with [GER.GetLeader] has brought both sides together for the time being, it remains to be seen whether this so-called friendship will last, and whether this conference will truly lead to a better future for Europeans..."
 Yalta_Conference.3.A: "Another blow to Nazi tyranny!"
 Yalta_Conference.3.B: "Who do they think they are to decide the fate of a continent?"
 Yalta_Conference.3.C: "Surely a historic moment."
 
 Yalta_Conference.4.t: "Proposing the Division"
 Yalta_Conference.4.d: "President [USA.GetLeader] rubbed his chin as he studied a map of Europe. The Soviets had been relentlessly advancing westward, dominating European battlefields. He could see why the Soviets were eager to decide the fate of the continent as soon as possible.\n\n"Sir..." the President turned around to face his private advisory committee. "I propose that we deny the Soviets any influence over Germany. They already control much of Eastern Europe, and losing Germany could mean Soviet dominance over all of Europe." said one of the members.\n\n"I disagree," said another. "I believe the Soviet demands are justified; after all, they have lost more men and material than all of the other Allied powers combined. In my opinion, the Soviets would want vengeance on the Germans and would accept nothing less."\n\nThe members began murmuring to one another. Their voices soon began to rise, and the room became engulfed in a heated debate. The President was deep in thought the entire time. There had to be another option. A happy medium. A reasonable compromise.\n\n"Gentlemen, I believe there is an alternative." President [USA.GetLeader] looked up, almost as if the man who said it was an angel from heaven himself. "We could simply divide Germany in two, with the east going to the Soviets and the rest going to the Allies."\n\nThe suggestion surprised the President. He began weighing the benefits and drawbacks. It would undoubtedly satisfy the Soviets, but it would imply brutal occupation of East Germans. It meant preserving Europe's balance of power at the expense of tearing the German people apart. It meant European peace, but it also meant the annihilation of thousands of German families...."
 Yalta_Conference.4.A: "There is no other way."
 
 Yalta_Conference.5.t: "The American Proposal"
 Yalta_Conference.5.d: "The time was nearing midnight. Prime Minister [ENG.GetLeader] was just settling into his Yalta residence when his aide informed him that the American President was waiting for him in the study. He couldn't see why the President would want to meet him at this hour. Nonetheless, he was intrigued.\n\n"It's great to see you again, President [USA.GetLeader]." As he sat beside the President, he smiled graciously. "It's also good to see you, Prime Minister." The smile was returned by the President.\n"Given that it's nearly midnight, and given that we have to attend the conference tomorrow morning, I suppose we should skip the small talk and get right to the point?" [ENG.GetLeader] lit a cigarette.\n"Of course. What do you make of the Soviet demands so far? I assume you're aware of the current situation in Eastern Europe?"\n"Absolutely."\n"Germany will be the next item on their agenda. And I believe I have a solution to resolve this conflict peacefully."\n"Tell me."\n"We divide Germany in half. The Soviets get the east, and we get the rest."\n\n[ENG.GetLeader]'s cigarette fell from his mouth. "Are you suggesting, Mr. President, that we tear Germany apart?"\n"I... am," the President said, his voice heavy. "It is the only way to meet Soviet demands without completely upsetting Europe's power balance."\n"But what about the German people? Surely they will not appreciate us destroying their country in this manner?"\n"Well, they lost the war, Prime Minister, and they can't expect to be treated well after what they did."\n\nAs terrible as the suggestion seemed, the President seemed to be making a point. Perhaps it really was the only way..."
 Yalta_Conference.5.A: "\"With a heavy heart, I shall support this proposal.\""
 
 Yalta_Conference.6.t: "The Western Proposal"
 Yalta_Conference.6.d: "[SOV.GetLeader] tried his hardest to smile while waiting for the British and American anthems to end. After what seemed like an eternity, the dignitaries were allowed to take their seats at the negotiation table and begin the talks.\n\n[SOV.GetLeader] was well aware that the Westerners would reject his claims. He desired vengeance on the Germans and had made it clear to Western Powers' representatives that he would not accept any negotiations unless Germany was crushed to the ground. However, he had come to reconsider his position over time. Maybe he was too harsh. He'd understand if they thought it was outrageous.\n\nBut he had to stand firm in his assertions. If he conceded any ground, the capitalists would undoubtedly push him further back. In any case, his country had fared far worse than theirs. He had the body count to prove it. He took a deep breath as he saw President [USA.GetLeader] and Prime Minister [ENG.GetLeader] nod solemnly to each other.\n\n"Premier [SOV.GetLeader], after considerable debate, Prime Minister [ENG.GetLeader] and I have decided to accept your claims," the American President said with a deep sigh. He gave him a signed document. [SOV.GetLeader]'s shoulders relaxed. He couldn't believe it. He decided to look over the document.\n\nAs he read through it, it became clear that the Westerners had, indeed, conceded. All the document required now was his signature and the fate of Germany would be sealed.\n\nBut maybe he could push for more. He could argue that these concessions weren't good enough for the casualties his nation had taken. Maybe he could push for more.... or maybe he should be satisfied with what he had."
 Yalta_Conference.6.A: "Sign the agreement."
 Yalta_Conference.6.B: "The lost Soviet lives are worth more than this!"
 
 Yalta_Conference.7.t: "The Soviets Accept"
 Yalta_Conference.7.d: "American President [USA.GetLeader] could see the corners of Premier [SOV.GetLeader]'s mouth curl into a slight smile as he read the document they presented. He smiled as the Soviet leader read through every line of the file. He recognised that he was being paranoid.\n\nThe President, on the other hand, knew there was no reason to be concerned. The document contained statements signed by himself and Prime Minister [ENG.GetLeader] that gave [SOV.GetLeader] everything he desired and more. After much deliberation, they concluded that future Soviet cooperation and postwar peace in Europe were far more important than any petty territorial disputes. The President felt at ease, knowing that with [SOV.GetLeader] signing the document, most of Europe's potential conflicts would be resolved.\n\nThe British Prime Minister [ENG.GetLeader], on the other hand, was not so relieved. He was out of breath as he watched the Soviet leader read the document. No matter how hard he tried, his fingers kept fidgeting. The American President had coerced him into a deal that gave the Soviets unprecedented control over Eastern Europe, and he was now having second thoughts. Even though he knew there was no other way to keep European peace, he was uneasy about the proposal. Something deep within him hoped the Soviets would reject the proposal and demand more.\n\n"This is fantastic, honourable delegates. I will gladly sign the agreement on behalf of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics." The words of [SOV.GetLeader] shattered any remaining hope in him. "And there it is..." he reflected."
 Yalta_Conference.7.A: "\"The fate of Europe has been sealed.\""
 
 Yalta_Conference.8.t: "The Yalta Conference Is a Success"
 Yalta_Conference.8.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]In a historic moment, delegates from [ENG.GetNameDef], [USA.GetNameDef], and [SOV.GetNameDef] have concluded negotiations in Yalta and agreed on a concrete vision for Europe's future.\n\nWhen asked about the agreement, President [USA.GetLeader] stated, "This agreement ensures European peace and stability for many years to come. It will serve as the foundation for rebuilding Europe after this heinous war."\n\n"We are very glad to have reached an agreement with the Soviets, and we look forward to cooperating with them for mutual development in the future," said the British Prime Minister.\n\n"After these years of brutal war, it will be greatly beneficial for the peoples of Europe to finally focus on redevelopment and growth, rather than destruction and conquest," said Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov.\n\nWhile the agreement's exact terms have not yet been made public, sources within the delegations claim that it grants [SOV.GetNameDef] unrivalled control over Eastern Europe. It remains to be seen how the agreement will be implemented."
 Yalta_Conference.8.A: "Finally we will have world peace!"
 Yalta_Conference.8.B: "Nothing but a farce!"
 
 Yalta_Conference.9.t: "The Soviets Decline"
 Yalta_Conference.9.d: "As he watched Premier [SOV.GetLeader] read the document, President [USA.GetLeader] rubbed his hands under the table. More than the biting cold of the Yalta wind, the President was chilled by the Soviet leaders' reaction to the proposal. The Premier made no attempt to hide his dissatisfaction with the proposal. He rubbed his moustache, shook his head, and murmured, "This won't do," throughout the reading.\n\n"Respected delegates," Premier [SOV.GetLeader] said after a while. "The Soviet people do not believe that this settlement is fair in comparison to the suffering they endured and the efforts they made to defeat Germany. As a result, as their representative at this table, I must decline this offer."\n\nThe President responded, "Premier [SOV.GetLeader], we have given you unprecedented control over Eastern Europe and Germany. Are you saying that half of Europe isn't enough for you?"\n\n"Indeed," [SOV.GetLeader] said.\n\n"Well, it appears that the negotiations have failed. We'll have to come back to this later " said the British Prime Minister. He never had much faith in the debate in the first place, and he was opposed to giving the Soviets half of Europe as well.\n\nAs he stood up to leave the negotiating table, the President appeared defeated. He had no leverage with the Soviets relentlessly pursuing more control over Europe and his only ally at the table leaving. It was pointless to continue the negotiations."
 Yalta_Conference.9.A: "We will have to get back to this some other time."
 
 Yalta_Conference.10.t: "The Yalta Conference Is Inconclusive"
 Yalta_Conference.10.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]After days of intense negotiations in Yalta, it appears that delegates from [ENG.GetNameDef], [USA.GetNameDef], and [SOV.GetNameDef] were unable to reach an agreement on the fate of postwar Europe.\n\nPresident [USA.GetLeader] of the United States stated, "This was a tremendous effort to maintain peace and stability in postwar Europe. However, no such peace can be achieved as long as the Soviets refuse to compromise on their expansionist ideals."\n\nAccording to Prime Minister [ENG.GetLeader], "The Soviet leadership has repeatedly thwarted our attempts at peace. They will need to rethink their positions on certain issues and return to the negotiating table with a more open mind."\n\nVyacheslav Molotov, Soviet Foreign Minister, stated, "The Soviet leadership felt that the offer was insufficient in comparison to the suffering we endured during the war. We have the right to ask for more. Millions of Soviet lives were lost in the war, and we will seek restitution!"\n\nWhile the West and the Soviets are locked in an ideological standoff, Nazi Germany is shrinking by the day. It is hoped that the Great Powers will reach an agreement before the war ends. In any case, for now, the fate of Europe remains to be seen."
 Yalta_Conference.10.A: "They have to put their differences aside."
 Yalta_Conference.10.B: "They cannot agree to save their own skins!"
