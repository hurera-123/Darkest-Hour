 ### Economic Events
 CHI_Economy.1.t: "Rising Silver Prices Cripple the Yuan"
 CHI_Economy.1.d: "[CHI.GetNewsIcon]It seemed that our country was going to avoid the effects of the Depression, even experiencing a boom in exports while the rest of the world was suffering from deflation.\n\n We were wrong. \n\nSince the first years of the Republic of China, our silver reserves establishes the value of our currency. However, countries around the globe are starting to depreciate their currencies and the price of silver is starting to rise as a result. This is causing a severe deflation that is negatively affecting the value of the Chinese yuan on the foreign exchange markets, that has no sign of stopping any time soon."
 CHI_Economy.1.A: "This is not looking good"

 CHI_Economy.2.t: "The Depression Worsens"
 CHI_Economy.2.d: "[CHI.GetNewsIcon]Our current financial crisis has just gotten worse. \n\nAs part of their new interventionist policies, the United States government has recently begun buying greats amounts of silver to inflate the prices of the metal. This is causing silver to flow from the interior of China to the financial center of Shanghai where is exported to the United States, causing a catastrophic price deflation that is greatly affecting our agriculture and our industry. As the financial crisis worsens, China's economic future remains uncertain."
 CHI_Economy.2.A: "Damn you, Yanks!"

 CHI_Economy.3.t: "United States Silver Purchase Act"
 CHI_Economy.3.d: "[CHI.GetNewsIcon]Another blow to our economy. \n\nContinuing their policies of purchasing silver in great amounts, the United States Government passed the Silver Purchase Act that facilitates the purchase of silver abroad until the world price of silver rises above $1.29 per ounce. While this legislation was probably made just to support American silver producers, this has unintended consequences for us. With the price of silver jumping rapidly worldwide, silver is flowing out of China even faster. Not only deflation is skyrocketing, but our own exports are shrinking. The banks are withdrawing notes out of circulation after selling their silver abroad, and the lack of supply of bank notes caused the prices to fall affecting many businesses and their workers in the process. Since we have to relay on more loans, our debt policy is becoming even more of a burden. We need to do something about the silver efflux, specially the private banks responsible for this problem."
 CHI_Economy.3.A: "We are the meal and they are the carving knife"

 CHI_Economy.4.t: "Controls Placed on Silver Exchange"
 CHI_Economy.4.d: "[CHI.GetNewsIcon] We need to stop the uncontrolled deflation that is wreaking havoc in our economy at all costs. That's why we decided to impose controls on the foreign exchange of silver to put an end to the efflux of the metal. This would consist on a duty of 10 percent and an equalization charge, with both being adjusted daily, that have the aim of making the export of silver unprofitable. Since the forces behind the rise of the price of silver have no interest in stopping their operations, we need to take matter into our own hands to protect the economic welfare of the people of China."
 CHI_Economy.4.A: "Let's see if it works"

 CHI_Economy.5.t: "The Depression Begins to Improve!"
 CHI_Economy.5.d: "[CHI.GetNewsIcon] Our measures to combat deflation are bearing some fruits. Since we imposed duty and equalization charges on the silver market, silver exports have fallen off dramatically. However, selling silver remains a profitable activity, so we had to sell foreign currency to stabilize our own. Some high-ranking government officials suggested that the silver-standard makes the effects price fluctuations unavoidable, and we should abandon it in favor a foreign-based currency. Our government is caught in the dilemma of preserving silver or preserving foreign currencies. It looks like more structural changes will be necessary to put the economy back on track."
 CHI_Economy.5.A: "Finally some good news"

 CHI_Economy.6.t: "Chiang Kai-shek Speaks against bankers"
 CHI_Economy.6.d: "[CHI.GetNewsIcon] While our government struggles to solve this crisis, the private banks are trying to cut ties with us. The largest private bank of the country, the Bank of China, is attempting to liquidate our bonds, which could make us unable to continue financing through debts. In return, Chiang Kai-shek and the new finance minister, H H Kung, are blaming the banks for the economic crisis, accusing them of seeking profit above the interests of the public. The newspapers are supporting these claims, with angry citizens voicing their discontent with the greedy banks. This shift in public opinion thanks to this effective propaganda campaign allowed us to convince the private banks to provide emergency funds for businesses affected by the deflation. But we need to go further if we want to end this crisis."
 CHI_Economy.6.A: "This is their fault"

 CHI_Economy.7.t: "The Banking Coup"
 CHI_Economy.7.d: "[CHI.GetNewsIcon] The era of unscrupulous bankers ruining the economy with their greed is over. Today, Minister Kung has announced the nationalization of two major private banks in China: the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. This takeover was possible by holding enough shares in both banks, with the government effectively becoming the majority stockholder. Some argue that the emergency funds used to buy the shares could have been used to aid the business affected by the crisis, but it was a necessary sacrifice to stop the deflation. More patriotic appointees willing to serve the country instead of themselves will replace the old bankers that have caused this mess in the first place. Since we now are in control the two biggest banks in China, we’ll be able to take control of the remaining private banks in the future by hoarding their banknotes."
 CHI_Economy.7.A: "We are the banks now!"

 CHI_Economy.8.t: "Fabi Currency Introduced"
 CHI_Economy.8.d: "[CHI.GetNewsIcon] The prospect of a total financial catastrophe makes it necessary to enact an ambitious monetary and banking reform. To finally end our long-time dependence on silver reserves, the government will issue a new currency detached from the silver standard: the Fabi. The new banknotes are full legal tender to use in public and private transactions and the payment of taxes. Chinese citizens and other private institutions are required to hand over their remaining silver reserves to the newly formed Currency Reserve Board to use the new currency, which we'll use for our debts with the United States. The process of distribution of the Fabi banknotes is going to be handled gradually and carefully to avoid inflation, with banknotes issued by other banks allowed to circulate in amounts fixed by the government, but eventually retiring from the market. The illegal possession and smuggling of silver are forbidden, and violators will be severely punished by the law. The government also announced the establishment of a new \"Currency Stabilisation Fund\" that allows purchasing and selling foreign currency, which we hope will maintain the hopes of the people on the newly established currency."
 CHI_Economy.8.A: "Good riddance to the silver thorn"

 CHI_Economy.9.t: "The Economy Improves!"
 CHI_Economy.9.d: "[CHI.GetNewsIcon] After an initial period of implementation, it appears our new currency policies are beginning to show signs of success. In Shanghai, wholesale prices are approaching levels that were seen just before the economic downturn. The most apparent changes, however, seem to be occurring in the rural villages. Market values for crops and livestock are rising steadily, while the average farmer’s expenses have remained mostly flat. With commodity prices increasing, many of our agricultural sectors are reporting break-even budgets and a handful are reporting profits! While on the whole there is more work to be done, with purchasing power increasing, further economic improvement and stabilization is expected in the coming months."
 CHI_Economy.9.A: "A Rebound for the Farmers!"

 CHI_Economy.10.t: "Inflation Spirals Out of Control!"
 CHI_Economy.10.d: "[CHI.GetNewsIcon] When our economy seemed that it was about to recover, disaster strikes once again. Printing money in mass to support the new currency proved to be a great mistake, as inflation started to grow out of control. The supposed solution to fix the problem of the silver standard only created another one even bigger. As a result, prices are skyrocketing, threatening the livelihoods of millions of farmers across the countryside. Even worse: it is likely that our situation could worsen even more if we go to war. Since we need money to improve the economy and repay our loans, it is unsure how long this inflation is going to last."
 CHI_Economy.10.A: "Damn it!"

 CHI_Economy.11.t: "Bank Run!"
 CHI_Economy.11.d: "[CHI.GetNewsIcon] Panic on the streets of our urban cities! Fueled by the news of Japan’s Declaration of War, Chinese citizens across Nanjing and Shanghai have rushed to their local banks to withdraw whatever money they can. Morale is low as people are desperate to empty their accounts and keep their finances close. Some banks are taking measures to limit the amount customers can withdraw on a given day, others are closing altogether. Government bonds are being sold back at the highest rate on record and consequently, the value of our guarantees is plummeting. While we expected some chaos initially if the situation continues to escalate, we may have to intervene in order to keep our economic condition afloat during this crisis."
 CHI_Economy.11.A: "Maybe I should go to the bank too?"

 ### Operation Nekka
 CHI_Operation_Nekka.1.t: "An Ultimatum from the Kwantung Army"
 CHI_Operation_Nekka.1.d: "To whom it may concern,\n\nThe act perpetrated by the Northeastern Army yesterday on January 1, 1933 is an unacceptable act on many fronts. They have violated the national sovereignty of the State of Manchuria without due cause, have harassed, intimidated, and even attacked soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army without any cause whatsoever, and have caused irreparable damage to the fragile peace in the region. We of the Empire of Japan, whose sole duty is the protection of the State of Manchuria's sovereignty, has seen the Northeastern Army, and by extension the Republic of China, as warmongers who have no restraint in violating Manchuria's sovereignty and independence.\n\nAs such, we hereby demand the cessation of hostilities along the Shanhaiguan sector of the Manchurian-ROC border. The Northeastern Army's 626th Regiment and all other troops of the Northeastern Army are to hereby evacuate from the area swiftly and with haste. Failure to concede to our demands will result in a military response by the Empire of Japan.\n\nDo not test our resolve."
 CHI_Operation_Nekka.1.A: "It is humiliating, but we must kow-tow to the Rising Sun..."
 CHI_Operation_Nekka.1.B: "How dare these Japanese scum to threaten us, get this out of my sight!"

 CHI_Operation_Nekka.2.t: "A Report from Shanhaiguan"
 CHI_Operation_Nekka.2.d: "Shanhaiguan is an important strategic position of the Great Wall that separates Manchuria from China. It was in this place where the armies of Prince Dorgon defeated the forces of the rebel Shun dynasty in 1644, assuring the rule of the Qing for the following centuries. History repeated itself once again when another army took control of the pass, but it was a far more ruthless and powerful opponent.\n\nUsing an alleged grenade attack as an excuse, a Japanese commander of the Kwantung Army ordered the men of the 626th Regiment to evacuate the pass. Naturally, this blatant violation of our sovereignty just to take control of the position, that included calling our soldiers \"terrorists\", was rejected by the garrison. The attack came shortly after. Using improvised bamboo ladders, the Japanese tried to make their way into the pass. Despite having only a bunch of light weapons and the ancient fortifications from the Ming Dynasty as defense, our men made a heroic stand against the Japanese attack. The fight quickly became a vicious close-quarters brawl, with men falling on both sides at the edge of bayonets and broadswords. But even bravery can't overcome the combined power of tanks, planes, warships and armored trains, and the garrison had to evacuate the position after days of brutal fighting.\n\nNot even this masterpiece of human fortification and symbol of Chinese national pride could stop the Japanese onslaught. The cruelty of modern warfare doesn't care at all about the remains of the past. Our reports indicate that the Japanese plan to concentrate their advance towards the mountains of Rehe. The Kwantung Army shows no intention of stopping at the Great Wall."
 CHI_Operation_Nekka.2.A: "This barbarian scum will pay for this!"

 CHI_Operation_Nekka.3.t: "Japan is claiming Rehe!"
 CHI_Operation_Nekka.3.d: "Once again, the Kwantung Army is grasping for justification on taking more parts of our Northern Territory. According to a communique from senior officials, the Japanese are claiming that the province of Rehe is a historical portion of Manchuria, even though it has been under Chinese dominion for nearly 300 years. In fact, previous Qing Emperors would spend summers in the region, visiting the Great Wall and staying in the Mountain Resort at Chengde. Despite that, Kwantung officials are pushing that Rehe was stolen from the Manchu people and are seeking a way to undermine our influence in the area. Obviously we have sent a response that the claims are absolutely baseless and we shall defend our sovereign territory.\n\nIt is unlikely, given the history of Japanese aggression in Manchukuo, that the situation will be dropped anytime soon. Furthermore, our scouts observing Japanese movements north of the area are sending reports of large supply convoys as well as increased and suspicious troop activity. Unfortunately, even with our rebuttal to the Japanese, a war could be on the frontier within a matter of days."
 CHI_Operation_Nekka.3.A: "The Japanese have no bounds..."

 CHI_Operation_Nekka.4.t: "Japanese Delegates meeting with General Tang!"
 CHI_Operation_Nekka.4.d: "In our ongoing conflict, Tang Yulin is currently ruling the region of the Rehe. The so-called \"toad general\" doesn't exactly have the best of records. In addition to his unpopular land taxes to buy properties in Tianjin, his tendency to accept extortions, and his lavish and extravagant banquets, he also controls the majority of the opium trade in Rehe. However, this particular incident proves that even the most corrupt generals aren't willing to sell the country to the enemy. It came to us that the Japanese meet General Tang to convince him to support their takeover of the Rehe region. Surprisingly enough, the governor refused the offer, which led to the Japanese trying to conquer the region. This should speak very highly of the governor for refusing to defect to the Japanese. However, there are already rumors that General Tang plans to leave Rehe with his wealth, which speaks volumes in how ill-prepared our forces are."
 CHI_Operation_Nekka.4.A: "Everyone has standards"

 CHI_Operation_Nekka.5.t: "The Catastrophic Rehe Incident"
 CHI_Operation_Nekka.5.d: "The incident at the border has been nothing but one catastrophe after another. The ruthless Kwantung Army convinced their weak Emperor to authorize an invasion of the Rehe province, and our forces are unable to stop the attack. The local commander Tang Yulin is unprepared to face the attack, ignoring the orders of Marshal Zhang Xueliang. Soldiers are surrendering in mass, some even defecting to the enemy. While the National Revolutionary Army doesn't lack competent commanders or brave soldiers willing to protect China, the lack of training and equipment makes it impossible to resist an enemy that is roughly equal in size.\n\nThe result of the poor state of our armed forces is evident. The Kwantung Army took Chaoyang and Chifeng, only encountering token resistance from Sun Dianying's forces. Eventually, Japanese tanks reached the capital of Rehe, Chengde. Our reinforcements arrived too late to save the province from the combined strength of the Japanese and Manchukuo armies. The NRA managed to put a better fight at the Lengkou Pass despite being armed with swords, but overwhelming Japanese firepower forced them to retreat. Only a couple of obsolete fortifications stand now between Northern China and the Kwantung Army.\n\nThe League of Nations supported our claim that Manchukuo is an illegitimate state, but this gesture doesn't mean anything if it doesn't translate in support to stop the Japanese aggression. We didn't want this battle in the first place, and it is obvious now that we can't win at all. It seems that our only choice is to accept whatever demands the Kwantung Army decides to make."
 CHI_Operation_Nekka.5.A: "What a disaster!"

 CHI_Operation_Nekka.6.t: "Zhang Discharged from Duty"
 CHI_Operation_Nekka.6.d: ""
 CHI_Operation_Nekka.6.A: "Get that idiot off the front, and send him to fight the Communists!"

 CHI_Operation_Nekka.7.t: "The Rehe Secession"
 CHI_Operation_Nekka.7.d: "After several meetings with provincial leaders, army officers and diplomats, we have reached an inescapable conclusion. With the Kwangtung Army itching to launch an attack into southern Manchuria and knowing our positional defenses in the area, mounting a successful defense of Rehe appears to be an impossible task. We are simply spread too thin in too large an area, especially with the Japanese’s ability to rapidly redeploy their forces. The outlook is expectedly dire among high command as well, for they too know it is an unworkable situation.\n\nTherefore, at the direction of the government and the army, we are drafting a letter to formally cede control of the province to the Kwangtung Army. The letter will state that while we don’t believe in the insane notation that Rehe is a modern part of Manchuria, avoiding a costly war between Asian superpowers is the best outcome for everyone. Privately, backing down will allow us an even more precious commodity than land: time. High Command is creating detailed maps of the area so that when we eventually have offensive plans in place, we can destroy the Manchukuo puppet and evict the Japanese from the mainland itself.\n\nUnfortunately, foreign powers will see this as an appeasement. We will order our officials to try and spin this in some possible positive way, but villages all along the border will see this outcome as the central government’s inability to defend the frontiers. Our rule will be challenged on the fringes of our domain and surely more crises will come from this decision. But it will maintain the status quo, at least for the time being."
 CHI_Operation_Nekka.7.A: "A humiliating defeat, but a humble decision"

 ### Tanggu Truce
 CHI_Tanggu_Truce.1.t: "A Meeting in Tianjin"
 CHI_Tanggu_Truce.1.d: "Following our staggering defeat from the Japanese in Rehe, we find ourselves facing pressure on all fronts. The civil war rages on, providing ample distraction for the National Army in the face of an external invasion. Thus, when we received the invitation for negotiations, we were in no position to argue.\n\nThe talks are set to take place in the Tanggu District of Tianjin. Whilst it is unlikely, we cannot help but hope for favorable terms. With the backing of the League of Nations and numerical superiority, the Japanese menace cannot sustain a full-scale invasion of mainland China. Perhaps they will be satisfied with the low-hanging fruit of Manchuria, an economic boon on its own. Either way, this has been a humiliating defeat for the Kuomintang, one which will not go without retribution."
 CHI_Tanggu_Truce.1.A: "Perhaps the bleeding can finally stop..."

 CHI_Tanggu_Truce.2.t: "The Issue of Manchuria"
 CHI_Tanggu_Truce.2.d: "Unsurprisingly, the Japanese marauders refuse to return Manchuria to its rightful owner, instead investing in the legitimacy of the new Manchukuo Empire, tarnishing the legacy of the Qing at every accord. With Puyi’s betrayal to his countrymen cemented, there is nothing left to do. The invaders will retain control over all territory north of the Great Wall, leaving millions of Chinese citizens under the oppressive thumb of Hirohito. Unfortunately, with the communist threat looming over the horizon, we can spare little blood nor sweat in the defense of extremity territories such as Manchuria. We will have to cut our losses and move on."
 CHI_Tanggu_Truce.2.A: "A small price to pay for our survival"

 CHI_Tanggu_Truce.3.t: "The Issue of Militarization"
 CHI_Tanggu_Truce.3.d: "The bastards have gone too far! In the wake of their recent successes in negotiations, the Japanese have used their leverage to establish a disruptive demilitarized zone extended one hundred kilometers south of the Great Wall, with the wall itself remaining under Japanese control as a “security measure” of sorts. With our main defenses rendered useless, we have no choice but to withdraw from the zone, leaving the outskirts of Peiping defenseless. The zone is to be policed by a Japanese-supervised Peace Preservation Corps, maintaining order in lieu of an organized Kuomintang police force. The situation is dire, but the cities are not lost yet. We may still recover!"
 CHI_Tanggu_Truce.3.A: "At least conflict is out of the question..."

 CHI_Tanggu_Truce.4.t: "The Issue of Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies"
 CHI_Tanggu_Truce.4.d: "It was far too optimistic to assume we would have any sway over the happenings of the demilitarized zone. The peace talks grew especially rowdy following the announcement that there would be several secret clauses to the armistice, specifically regarding the administration of the zone and makeup of the Peace Preservation Corps. Whilst the Kwantung Army is permitted to patrol the area inside the zone to ensure compliance, all members of the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies are barred from entry, thus ensuring that the Japanese have absolute control over the region. It would seem as though the demilitarized zone was simply a pretext to expand Kwantung influence into the continent. Caving to their demands has bought us time at the expense of the future."
 CHI_Tanggu_Truce.4.A: "They are still rebels nonetheless..."

 CHI_Tanggu_Truce.5.t: "The Tanggu Truce"
 CHI_Tanggu_Truce.5.d: "[CHI.GetNewsIcon] The Imperial Japanese hostility towards our great Republic was more than apparent, and their intent to act on that aggression was proven at the Mukden Incident. Our armies tried their best to brace themselves against the unrelenting forces of the Japanese, but our country is in desperate need of modernization before we can put up any effective resistance. The smoldering villages and the cries of children in the streets is able proof that our military isn't doing its job as it should. The humiliating losses our ground forces are suffering against the Imperialist Japanese have forced us to review the option of brokering peace with them, although we don’t expect a fair deal with the imperialist dogs. We are backed into a corner.\n\nThe League’s pitiful condemnation of the Japanese invasion of Manchuria proves that the League is too incompetent to protect the sovereignty of our nation and that it is up to us to preserve the Republic. We managed to meet with representatives of the Japanese government and negotiate an end to the bloody conflict that has been ravaging the north. The Japanese demands were straight to the point, we were to extend a demilitarized zone 100 kilometers south of the Great Wall from Beijing to Tianjin, with the Great Wall itself strictly under Japanese control. In our current position, we have no other choice but to sign the unfair agreement, either that or face the onslaught of the rogue armies of the Japanese Empire.\n\nThe traitorous Puyi sits atop his throne in the new Empire of Manchukuo, a mere loyal dog to the Japanese, while they reap the fruits of victory and our nation continues to suffer at the hands of the neglectful League of Nations, we must bide our time, Puyi and the Japanese will pay."
 CHI_Tanggu_Truce.5.A: "Yet again, another unequal treaty"
 tanggu_truce: "Tanggu Truce"

 ### Liangguang Incident
 CHI_Liangguang.1.t: "Hu Hanmin Dies" # CHI, GXC, GND
 CHI_Liangguang.1.d.CHI: "A new development has emerged inside the government. The Chairman of the Kuomintang, Hu Hanmin, has died in Guangzhou from a cerebral haemorrhage. Hu was one of the leading members of the right-leaning faction of the party and the de-facto ruler of Southern China. \n\nHe was also was critical of Chiang Kai-shek for his supposed lack of action against Japanese threats. While the death of the Chairman is a tragedy, we need to elect a replacement in his position to make sure that his cronies won’t take advantage of the situation to pursue their agenda. Securing our authority over Southern China will ensure that we will be prepared to face the next Japanese aggression."
 CHI_Liangguang.1.d.GXC: "Alarming news. The leader of the Kuomintang, Hu Hanmin, has died in Guangzhou from a cerebral haemorrhage. The Chairman was one of the main rivals of Chiang Kai-shek, criticizing his cowardice in dealing with the Japanese menace and the rampant corruption and cronyism that he enables inside the government. \n\nWith the death of our ally, Chiang Kai-shek will likely want to put one of his minions in charge to end our autonomy. This blatant attempt of power-grabbing is unacceptable: we need to neutralize Chiang’s attempts to monopolize power as soon as possible by contacting our allies in Guandong. Chiang is not going to humiliate us again!"
 CHI_Liangguang.1.d.GND: "Very concerning news! The Chairman of the Kuomintang, Hu Hanmin, has died in Guangzhou from a cerebral haemorrhage. The Chairman was one of the main rivals of Chiang Kai-shek, criticizing him for his lack of response regarding the Japanese menace and for enabling corruption inside the government. With the death of our ally, Chiang Kai-shek will likely seek to put one of his followers in charge to consolidate his hold over Southern China. This situation cannot be allowed to happen: we need to neutralize Chiang’s attempts to monopolize power as soon as possible by contacting our allies in Guangxi. That’s probably what the Chairman would have wanted."

After rejecting our ultimatum, they replied with a series of demands that included focusing our attention on Japan. This move would disrupt our campaign of internal pacification, exacerbating relations with Japan, and throwing us into a conflict we are not prepared for.\n\n With rumours of the Guangxi and Guangdong warlords plotting to move against Chang, the Southern frontier starts to get more agitated. Needless to say, this insolence won’t be tolerated. The Southwest cliques need to go, by force if it is necessary."

The rotten corrupt structure of the Kuomintang is putting the Chinese nation at risk, so drastic measures are necessary to give them a wake-up call."

 ### Trautmann Mediaition (China)
 CHI_Trautmann.1.t: "Germany offers Mediation"
 CHI_Trautmann.1.d: "We have been engaged in war with the Japanese for some time now, and it has not necessarily gone in our favour, but there is a potential way of preserving our country’s sovereignty and independence indefinitely. We have been good friends with the German government for many years now and considering their recently warming relations with our enemy, it is in their best interest to have both of us stop fighting.\n\nGermany’s ambassador to us, Oskar Trautmann has approached us about the possibility of mediating peace talks, which if successful, could prove highly useful, as we would be fully able to focus our efforts on the threat of the communist insurgents within our country. Despite this, we will not bow down to our enemy by accepting a deal that is unfavourable, putting us in a spot worse than the one we are currently in. With this in mind, we may choose to reject Trautmann’s offer to save us from potentially wasting time we could devote towards winning the war."
 CHI_Trautmann.1.A: "Perhaps the Nine Powers will save us, don't give them an answer"

 CHI_Trautmann.2.t: "Japan Pushes for Harsher Terms"
 CHI_Trautmann.2.d: "Scandal! Now with peace between us and the Empire of Japan seeming like a real possibility, these goddamn Imperialists have decided to swat hand away we extended to them, instead opting to spit on our attempts of reconciliation!\n\nAfter the first rounds of negotiations and some help by our mediator Oskar Trautmann, we had presented the first draft of a potential peace treaty to the Japanese, which would have been beneficial for both sides. True it was still a treaty of defeat for us, seeing as we would have to give up some Territory in Mongolia, establish a DMZ at the border and make Trade confessions to the Japanese it still would have meant a quick end to the war and peace between our nation.\n\nNow the Japanese delegation has returned after considering our initial offer and has promptly rejected it, presenting a new „improved“ treaty to us. And a truly outrageous treaty it is. Like in the previous Treaty we would have been forced to give up Inner Mongolia, while also establishing an even larger DMZ, one which would make any meaningful defense of the border against the Japanese simply not possible. Furthermore, we would have to make even further concessions,s which we inevitably would have to pay by shipping off almost the entirety of our spare industry to Japan.\n\nTrautmann already tried to convince the Japanese to reconsider their terms, but they have remained adamant. Now it remains for us to decide: Is this treaty worth the peace or should we rally ourselves for the continuation of the war?"
 CHI_Trautmann.2.A: "Peace must be achieved, no matter the price."
 CHI_Trautmann.2.B: "This Treaty would destroy China's future for decades to come. We reject."

 CHI_Trautmann.3.t: "Japan Terminates Negotiations"
 CHI_Trautmann.3.d: "[CHI.GetNewsIcon] It seems that once again the Japanese have rejected our proposals for Peace and have thus terminated the peace talks, initiated by Oskar Trautmann. Even when we offered the Japanese wide-reaching concessions in the form of land, money, industry, and more, the Imperialist Empire, driven by their greed and will to dominate the entirety of Asia, have chosen to push for harder terms, terms we simply could not fulfill. And so the war will once again continue, bringing suffering to millions of people.\n\nPerhaps it was foolish of us to push for peace, maybe the Japanese interpreted this a weakness to exploit or a sign that we considered the war unwinnable, but they will soon find that they are dead wrong. Our resistance will continue, unhindered by appeasement or politics, determined to struggle for survival we will fight this war to the last man and the last bullet. This war will either be China's greatest victory or its final defeat, a middle ground is no longer possible. The Japanese made sure of that."
 CHI_Trautmann.3.A: "In the face of history, our consciousness is clear - we never wanted this war."

 CHI_Trautmann.4.t: "Treaty of Shanghai"
 CHI_Trautmann.4.d: "[CHI.GetNewsIcon] After rounds of diplomatic talks, there appears to be a light at the end of the long tunnel. Ambassador Trautmann has led the negotiations between the Kwantung Army and our government for weeks now. It has been a chaotic conference, as walkout attempts have occurred on multiple topics. One occurrence leading to a week long pause, with Trautmann managing to reel both parties back to the table. It is clear there is an undisclosed German desire in peace between our countries but why remains a mystery. Regardless, our nation is weary and peace is desirable, on certain terms.\n\nThe drafted terms have been approved by both Trautmann and Germany itself. Japan is insisting the terms will only be binding for a brief time, so a decision is needed quickly. A summary follows:\n\nInner Mongolian autonomy, from both Japan and Chinese influence.\n\nThere will be two new demilitarized zones, one between Manchukuo and our northern frontier, and in Shanghai itself, with an international police presence.\n\nAll anti-Japanese policies enacted will be ceased.\n\nJapanese and Chinese forces will cooperate against communism in and around Asia.\n\nJapanese goods will be subjected to lower tariffs.\n\nForeign nation’s properties and rights in China will be respected.\n\nWith a peaceful solution in our sight, some government officials are split. We could end the conflict and focus on the communists in the south, but this could only be a momentary peace and the Japanese could break the terms, knowing how distrustful Kwantung officials are. Others are suggesting that a breakthrough in the north could come soon and ending the war now would halt a potential victory. In any case, China stands on a knife-edge and our nation is exhausted. How do we proceed?"
 CHI_Trautmann.4.A: "Accept the terms immediately, peace is a welcomed pause on the continent."
 CHI_Trautmann.4.B: "We still hold Shanghai and our military has the upper hand. Defer the agreement for a period of time."

 CHI_Trautmann.5.t: "A New Treaty Proposal"
 CHI_Trautmann.5.d: "After informing Japanese officials of our open position to another attempt at peace, they have returned with a draft of their requirements for a cease-fire. With Germany sidelined from this proposal, our best facilitator can only watch as the terms are read aloud. To say they are a brutal opposite to the original treaty would be a vast understatement. They are laid out as the following:\n\nManchukuo will be diplomatically recognized by the Republic of China\n\nInner Mongolia will retain autonomy from Japan and China\n\nAll anti-Japanese and anti-Manchukuo policies enacted by our government will be ceased.\n\nJapanese, Manchukuo and Chinese forces will cooperate in the annihilation of communism in and around Asia.\n\nChina will pay war reparations to Japan, the amount remaining conspicuously undisclosed.\n\nThe original two DMZ proposals would be included but expanded on the Chinese side.\n\nNew drafted trade agreements between China, Japan and Manchukuo\n\nThe war reparations clause alone is enough to give serious pause to our negotiating team. When the further DMZ expansions are read, audible gasps are heard from several administrators. Upon extended counseling with military officers and government officials, many have stated that the new DMZ border would be nearly impossible for our forces to defend. It remains to be seen how the war reparations will be divided but, knowing the Japanese, it is expected to be harsh. How do we respond to the proposition?"
 CHI_Trautmann.5.A: "Peace is peace, even if it is a painful one. Send the delegation our acceptance of the terms."
 CHI_Trautmann.5.B: "This is beyond our terms and is simply unacceptable. Do not respond to the ghastly document!"

After successfully destroying the communist bases in the border region of Hunan-Henan-Anhui, this time we will focus our attention on annihilating the Jiangxi Soviet. General He Yingqing is in charge of the operation, mobilizing over half a million men. The battle plan will consist first in deploying a blockade line to cut the Communist flow of supplies, and then the center front will attack the Communist base with the support of both left and right flanks. This time we'll make sure that the Communist armies won't escape total destruction."

Since we underestimated the enemy strength and a series of miscommunications made the battle operations more difficult, our forces failed to dislodge the Communists at Lichuan. Even if we managed to inflict heavy casualties on the Red Army, our forces were ambushed and annihilated. The Communist were able to win this time, but their destruction is inevitable.

With our numbers bolstered by hesitant warlord participation and our change in strategy provided by the Germans, we hope we will finally have the strength to push the communists out from their positions.\n\nWe plan to use fortification warfare to force the communists into a battle of attrition, in which we lure them into fortified areas and force them into combat with our entrenched troops. Once they have been exhausted from their combat strength and manpower, we intend to move in and crush them while the warlords, who we expect to commit mildly to the war effort, stay behind and act as block troops and garrison occupied areas. The fields will run red with blood."

 CHI_Civil_War.5.d: "After a short vacation, Chiang Kai-Shiek is now back to work. The Generalissimo has arrived in Nanchang to personally prepare his forces for the new operation against the Jiangxi Soviet. This time, more than half-a-million men were mobilized from all regions of China to organize a large-scale fifth encirclement and suppression of the Red Army. With the help of the staff member of the Nanchang Battalion, Liu Weiyuan, the high command led by Chiang is developing a new strategy based on pursuing the fleeing enemy instead of encircling them risking a battle of attrition. \n\nThrough these careful preparations, we expect to finally rid the country of the Red plague."
 CHI_Civil_War.5.A: "His presence will inspire the men"

 CHI_Civil_War.6.t: "German Military Advisors Propose New Strategy"
 CHI_Civil_War.6.d: "Fortunately, we are not alone in our fight against Communism. Advisors from Germany, Hans von Seeckt and Alexander von Falkenhausen, have been present in the country for months, and they will help us to develop new strategies to finally break the Red Army. Both officers propose that we use the systematic encirclement of the Jiangxi Soviet region with fortified blockhouses to blockade their access to supplies. To maximize the effectiveness of this strategy, we’ll introduce principles of both tactical defence and strategic offensives to our battle strategy. \n\nWith the Jiangxi Soviet gradually losing manpower and resources, we are optimistic about the outcome of the operation."
 CHI_Civil_War.6.A: "The Germans are truly the masters of war"

 CHI_Civil_War.7.t: "The Beginning of the Fifth Campaign" #september - mid-november
 CHI_Civil_War.7.d: "Nationalist Troops clashed in the grand combat stage that was destined to be the coffin of the Red Army. Soldiers of the Red Army charged hopelessly at fortifications constructed earlier in preparation for the battle, only to be slaughtered by oncoming machine gunfire. Artillery drowned out the screams of men as they fell before each other, men of the same blood slaughtering each other, a scene from hell.\n\nThe strategy planned out with the help of Hans von Seeckt was masterfully executed with astounding results. The communists soon found themselves on the back foot, lacking manpower and the will to fight against the superior tactics and overwhelming numbers of the Nationalist-warlord forces. Bitter attritional fighting forced the communists to withdraw from combat for now, but the campaign was far from over, they can only run for so long."

The 24th division of the Chinese Red Army expected a crushing victory with the hope of stopping our offensive, but they didn’t expect the bravery and the skill of our men. When the Red bandits entered the outskirts of Xiaoshi, they were properly received by a barrage of artillery and bullets. \n\nTime and time again, the Communists crashed against our fortified defences only to get bloody mauled every single time. The Generalissimo is greatly satisfied by this success and has issued new orders from Nanchang to keep perfecting the tactics developed with the help of our German friends. Now that we have proven to be capable of dealing with the Red Army, we are in conditions to finally obliterate them from the face of the Chinese nation."

 CHI_Civil_War.10.d: "The failure of the 4th encirclement campaign in the Spring of 1933 has left our military unconfident in their ability to root out the communists, but it remains Chiang Kai-Sheik's main goal to stabilize the republic internally, so we must continue the war indefinitely. We've seen many modernization developments within the Republic during our time cooperating with Germany, and one of the more favourable developments has occurred within the military. Hans von Seeckt has with his best intentions modernized our forces to some degree of professionalism. We can only hope this will bear some fruit.\n\nBlockhouses were constructed all along the predicted combat zones and roads with the intention to scorch everything around them, in which we hope to beat the communists through a war of attrition and superior firepower. With this new strategy and professional German officer training, we hope this will give us the necessary strength to root out the communist filth. We can only pray this doesn't turn into the same slaughter that occurred in the last campaign.\n\nHopefully, the German's efforts have paid off."

The communists foolishly decided to engage us in our elaborate defences we had constructed previously, and it was nothing short of a massacre. In their attempts to flush our troops our from the blockhouses we built, they took heavy casualties and did little to remove us from our defensive positions.\n\nTo our surprise, warlord forces engaged in the offensive with us in coordination with our armies, which only reinforced the hammer that smashed their forces so valiantly. Their help is appreciated, but we can only suspect they wish to claim some of the glory for themselves. The last image burned inside the minds of our troops was the scene of the communists running in panic, exactly what we wanted.\n\nAlthough the offensive was a decisive victory for us, we don't have time to become arrogant with our victory, we must prepare for another offensive to drive them out. We can almost see the final victory against the communists, we just have to push a little more."

Conflicting reports have done nothing to soothe the situation, and our high command has been left paralyzed.\n\nA telegram had been received in Nanjing from Chiang's captors demanding an immediate end to the civil war against the communists and for a subsequent shift towards readying the country for a war against Japan instead, as well as expelling pro-Japanese factions and adopting an anti-Japanese stance.

Though it is hard to imagine any nation or peoples willing allowing themselves to become a slave to Tokyo, we have already seen how far traitors are willing to go in order to secure their own personal safety and power.\n\nIf we call their bluff and move to dismantle whatever makeshift political organization they’ve created up there, we run a real risk of ending up at war with Japan, which we aren’t well prepared for yet.

To combat these despicable individuals and restore the reputation of our party, we must greatly restrict access to Kuomintang membership, by both reducing the maximum size of regional branches, as well as enacting stronger controls to test initiates on their political conviction. This will, in combination with other measures, greatly restore the status of our party, while also combating corruption in China as a whole."

 CHI_Reorganize_NRA_desc: "The National Revolutionary Army was formed by the Kuomintang almost a decade ago and under the command of Chiang Kai-shek, played an essential role in the successful Northern Expedition campaign. Despite some assistance from foreign military powers like Germany, the NRA has now become a cesspool of corruption and incompetence, a pairing that could prove disastrous if not resolved quickly. The rehabilitation of the army will be a monumental task for the Generalissimo, and if he fails, the great ideals that Sun Yat-sen wished to be imparted upon China could be lost forever."

 CHI_War_Theory: "Modern in Name"
 CHI_War_Theory_desc: "While the NRA was originally intended to be a new step towards a modern Chinese army, which was to represent China's progress on a military scale, the reality has so far been found to be disappointing. Years of corruption, an overcomplicated bureaucracy, and bickering inside the ranks have turned this Army, which is supposed to be modern, into an unorganized, underequipped, and barley capable mess of various divisions, armies and warlord-warbands none of which is controlled by a unified command structure.\n\nIf we seriously want to reform the NRA into the fighting force it was meant to be we will have to undertake serious reforms posthaste."

 CHI_Professional_Army: "60 Division Plan"
 CHI_Professional_Army_desc: "Hans von Seeckt, a general of the German army, has performed in the capacity of an advisor to the Generalissimo for some time and has proposed a radical new plan that could improve our army ten-fold. This plan, the “60 Division Plan” is self-explanatory, detailing that we should focus on forming sixty highly trained and well-equipped divisions. These divisions should, in theory, perform to a much higher level than one hundred inconsistent and poorly equipped divisions, giving us the best chance possible of defending the country from any imperialist powers."

 CHI_Human_Wave: "10 Year Compromise"
 CHI_Human_Wave_desc: "Even though the 60 division plan proposed by Hans von Seeckt is undoubtedly a solid idea and would greatly improve our military situation it glosses over a few simple facts, which sadly render it unfeasible for our current situation.\n\nOne hand our control of the country and especially the warlord armies is not sufficient enough to enact these radical changes, while most warlords aligned with us would violently oppose our attempts at imposing the proposed military reforms on them. In addition to this our lack of industrialization and dedicated armament factories makes it simply impossible for us to maintain an army of this size and equipment grade.\n\nTo still reap the benefits of von Seeckts' work, we have decided to go the middle route of creating a small number of division trained per the 60 division plan, which will make up the core of our army, while the old warlord divisions will be delegated to an assisting role."

 CHI_Selective_Integration: "German Trained Divisions"
 CHI_Selective_Integration_desc: "With the 60-Division plan in full swing, it has become time for us to organize our divisions along the lines envisioned Hans von Seeckt, our military advisor and mastermind behind the reforms, basically transforming our divisions into highly trained,well-equipped troops, organized following German doctrines. These divisions will form the main core of our army gradually replacing the various unorganized and ineffective warbands, brigades, and other such formations supplied to us by the different warlords.\n\nOf course we this process will take some time, mainly due to equipment short passes, the ever-constant feuding between different warlords, and the small number of German officers who can reliably train these new divisions, but with enough time the 60-division plan will turn the NRA into the pride of China!"

 CHI_Full_Integration: "German Style Army"
 CHI_Full_Integration_desc: "The German army, with its superior equipment, training and doctrine is a shining example of what every modern military should be. With our current situation on the world stage, we will need a strong army that can protect our nation and the ideals that Dr Sun Yat-sen wished to impart upon us. In order to do this, we shall try our best to emulate the army that the German’s possess and the values that they instill within their own troops. With sufficient investment and time, our army will become a force to be reckoned with, and will certainly give us the ability to fight off any foreign invaders."

 CHI_Political_Reorg: "Political Reorganization"
 CHI_Political_Reorg_desc: "The NRA was originally founded as a new type of Army, one that would be removed from the various pitfalls of political factionalism that plagued the old armies of the Qing. A fresh start for China's military, so to speak. However like so many things, the political factionalism sadly never went away and with the rampant warlordism even escalated. Today the NRA is perhaps one of the most divided militaries solely consisting of officer cliques, the warbands, and bandits under the command of the Warlords and Generals, who constantly seek to undermine the government.\n\nIf we want to solve this massive problem we will have to undertake a massive effort to reorganize the NRA, through any means necessary, if the Army shall one day be China's protectors and not its biggest threat and shame."

 CHI_Reconcile_Opposition: "Reconcile Opposition Generals"

And even though we still aren't on the best of terms with these opposition generals, they are still capable generals and a breed of men that the NRA and China desperately needs. To get these generals to our side, it has become time for us to extend our hands towards them and aim at reconciliation wherever possible, be it through promotions, political favors, or personal gifts until all the great warriors of China will lead the NRA to victory.

This has to stop now. These so-called „Opposition Generals“ must be removed at all costs, by any means necessary. And true, the NRA will lose many undeniably capable officers this way, but it is necessary, lest the army continues to paralyze itself to non-functionality, simply due to the ignorance of some of its commanders."

 CHI_Cull_Incompetency: "Promote Competent Officers"
 CHI_Cull_Incompetency_desc: "Many armies around the world are plagued with a grave illness — incompetency. Our army is no different. Too often are smart and hard-working officers passed over for promotion without a second thought. What makes this even worse, however, is officers who are tactically inept and lack the necessary skills but are owed political favours are given the higher positions. This has become a systemic problem that will take time to fix, but a strong first start will be to promote the officers that deserve it. This will not only begin to improve the working culture within our army, it will provide a boost to the performance of our soldiers in the field, which is certainly something we could use."

 CHI_Reward_Loyalty: "Reward Loyal Command"
 CHI_Reward_Loyalty_desc: "Since the dawn of the Warlord Era, premiums have been placed on loyalty to a local leader or faction. Military devotions have kept some in power well beyond the expectations of many political experts. If we are to be seen as the unifying force in China, we must create a system of rewards and benefits for those who show commitment to our command. Forming bonds between soldiers, officers and their generals would produce a hierarchy of allegiance. Dedication must be placed above all if we are to succeed in the struggle for the nation."

 CHI_Modern_Fighting_Force: "Modern in Practice"
 CHI_Modern_Fighting_Force_desc: "Being an up-to-date fighting force requires more than just polished rifles and brand new boots. In today’s advancing technological battlefield, a modern soldier needs to understand his equipment, tactics, provisions, and his knowledge of all things warfare. Updating our training and drills will require a tremendous amount of effort on the part of our military, but it will infinitely allow for better preparedness and give our forces a significant advantage, whether fighting the Kwantung Army or the Communists."

 CHI_Mass_Produced_Warfare: "Mass Produced Warfare"
 CHI_Mass_Produced_Warfare_desc: "Seemingly, no matter what government was in charge, China has always had an equipment issue on the battlefield. Our population size is just too large for our smaller industrial base to quickly handle. Mobilization of bodies rarely equals the equipment needed for each soldier, much less advanced weapon systems, such as tanks or airplanes. Overcoming this problem will be difficult, but through streamlining our existing industrial processes and heavily investing in newer military factories, our government can lay the groundwork for a new Chinese revolution in manufacturing and mass warfare."

Many upper government officials marvel at the prowess of America’s gold standards in war industry such as the Ford Motor Company or Douglas Aircraft. If we can bolster our own design firms and contract them to create and build different armaments for our forces, it would create a great sense of national pride and prove to the world that our Nationalist government is the true and only legitimate authority over China."

 CHI_Open_Taiyuan_Arsenal: "Open Taiyuan Arsenal Branches"
 CHI_Open_Taiyuan_Arsenal_desc: "It is no secret that our current industrial base is laughably unprepared to supply an Army the size of the NRA to a satisfying result and it shows, with a large portion of our soldiers being equipped with outdated rifles and little to no ammunition, while support weapons like machine guns and mortars being true rarities.\n\nSome divisions have seemingly reverted back to the middle ages and have started equipping their soldiers with swords, spears, and other primitive weapons due to the lack of other options.\n\nTo combat this grave state of affairs we will open a series of new arsenals, which will be used to produce to produce the arms and ammunition our army so desperately needs."

 CHI_Expand_Minsheng: "Expand Minsheng Industrial"
 CHI_Expand_Minsheng_desc: "While the recent improvements have helped us get back on track towards becoming an industrialized nation, the general state of our industry is still in an as sorry state. To further expand our industry and keep the current pace, in regards to industrial development, we should seek to further expand the Minsheng Industrial, one of the biggest factories in China.\n\nThis would allow us to further increase our production capacity, while also providing us with civilian factories, that in the event of a foreign invasion or escalated civil war, would be able to provide our army with the supplies it will need."

 CHI_Qishuyuan_Contracts: "Qishuyuan Machinery Contracts"
 CHI_Qishuyuan_Contracts_desc: "The most important factor in effectively industrializing a country is the availability of sufficient machinery to construct and maintain the desired factories, construction lines, and infrastructure. Sadly as it is with almost everything modern, China desperately lacks the needed machines to make any meaningful steps towards becoming a modern, industrialized nation.\n\n To amend this rather pitiful state we must reach out towards a variety of companies inside and outside of China and offer them lucrative market opportunities in China and a stable contract with the government as a guaranteed customer, in exchange for producing and selling modern industrial machinery inside China."

 CHI_Overhaul_Logistics: "Overhaul Logistical Systems"
 CHI_Overhaul_Logistics_desc: "Logistics in China have always been a tricky affair with the country encompassing an area of 9.000.000 square kilometers, many of which possess nothing resembling any sort of modern infrastructure, while other areas are controlled by warlords who often obstruct our supply lines, due to either political or personal reasons. It is thus no surprise that the logistic of the NRA is a similar mess with our logistics office simply not able to adequately supply our troops, wherever they currently might be. This has to stop as soon as possible if we want to have any chance against our foreign enemies. \n\nWe will thus completely overhaul the current process involved in supplying our army, while simultaneously expanding the number of logistics officers and supply depots throughout the country. While this might not be enough to completely solve our problems, it will still represent a step in the right direction and solve the most serious issues."

 CHI_Faction_Infighting_Whampoa_desc: "While the Republic of China is theoretically supposed to be a democratic country, the rampant factionalism inside every government institution has effectively brought all attempts at establishing anything that even remotely resembles a democratic political entity to a grinding halt. This everpresent infighting has helped the commander of the National Revolutionary Army §BChiang Kai-shek§! to cement himself as ruler of the Republic of China, establishing a military government in the process. And while this government so far has been able to at least keep a rather shaky resemblance of stability and government control over China, a lot needs to be done in order to finally fulfill the vision of Sun Yat-sen."

The Dynasties ruled with an iron fist, leeching off the common man and using his fortunes to prop up his master's pedestal of power. When we tore down the monarchy at that fateful day in Xinhai, it was replaced by an ambitious general who aimed to crown himself as Emperor. However, not today.\n\nNo longer shall we allow ambitious generals and bureaucrats take hold over this §YRepublic§!. It is time that we give rule to the people, allow them to guide this nation's future once and for all. §GThe Three Principles of the People§! would not be sidelined, it would be strengthened. Henceforth, we shall implement a series of reforms that shall be in line with our new mandate."
