 HOW_TO_PLAY_WINDOW_MECHANICS_ENTRY_ECONOMY_TITLE: "ECONOMY"
 HOW_TO_PLAY_WINDOW_MECHANICS_ENTRY_ECONOMY_DESC: "Aside from the new mechanics underway, we have created a rather special mechanic, one that can be utilized for any nation, regardless of its significance - Money System. Unlike most mods, who invest time and effort into the intricacies of economics, we have merely simplified it, in a way that is both equally important for gameplay yet easy to learn for both the player and the modder. \n\n§YHow does it work/How do you gain money?§!\n\nMoney is primarily gained from consumer goods factories and unused civilian factories. This emphasizes the importance of civilian factories, as they are only used as a way to build military factories, infrastructures, and trading with other nations. You can also earn money through taking out loans, although you have to remember to repay them, or it will take a hit on the economy, a BIG HIT.\n\n§YWhat can money be used for? How can we spend it?§!\n\nMoney is primarily spent for military factories - by assigning a factory to producing X, it will cost money. You can also spend the money for other things such as in events, decisions, or focuses. \n\n§YAre there any risks?§!\n\nInflation. Like any economies, inflation is vital for economic stability and harmony. Too much inflation, and you are diving into Venezuela or Weimar Republic style economies. It is important to manage inflation as much as possible, or it can seriously have consequences to the gameplay. Some of the main factors of inflation is by issuing new currency, or through loans. You can reduce inflation through "Deflationary Measures", but it is best to keep your economy in check or else...\n\n§YBankruptcy! Or "Everything is Fine"§!\n\nThis is the thing that you must truly avoid, or else your entire game has gone into a wreckfest. You will know if bankruptcy will happen because a countdown will start and all your money reserves are depleted. Gaining funds is of your major concern, or else the economy is in a death spiral."
 HOW_TO_PLAY_WINDOW_MECHANICS_ENTRY_PARLIAMENT_TITLE: "PARLIAMENT"
 HOW_TO_PLAY_WINDOW_MECHANICS_ENTRY_PARLIAMENT_DESC: "§YWhat is Parliament, Ideologies and Support?§!\n\nThe Parliament mechanic applies only to the democratic and authoritarian nations. Each party in a country has a main ideology and a sub-ideology. For example,“Democracy” is a main ideology, while “Social Democracy” is a sub-ideology. The parties all have a % of seats, a % of the support from the other parties in the actual government, and they also have a % of support from the population.\n\n§YWhat are the effects of the support?§!\n\nThe main objective of the support is to unlock some events/focuses, which impact what you can or can't do in your country. For example, some focuses will be locked if you don’t have 50% or 66% support.\n\n§YHow is it calculated?§!\n\nThe % of support is calculated with both the support of the party and the % of his seats. For example if the ruling party has 100% support but only 1% of seats, it won't have the same influence as if he had 10% support and 30% seats."
 HOW_TO_PLAY_WINDOW_MECHANICS_ENTRY_FACTIONS_TITLE: "FACTIONS"
 HOW_TO_PLAY_WINDOW_MECHANICS_ENTRY_FACTIONS_DESC: "§YWhat countries have factions?§!\n\nThe countries who don’t have a parliament can have factions instead. For example, Italy, Japan and Germany all have factions in the game. Italy, for instance, has a Mussolini faction, as well as a Monarchist one, both having their own objectives.\n\n§YHow are the influence and the opinion values calculated?§!\n\nYou can have a few of them, from 2 to a maximum of 5, and each faction has an influence value combined to an opinion value. The higher or lower their opinion and influence are, the more their specific buffs and debuffs are.\n\n§YHow can I change the influence of the opinion of a faction?§!\n\nYou can change it with some focuses or events, and it can then change either with an amount of value or a weekly change. For example, in Germany, if you chose a focus about the SS, you can increase or decrease their influence, depending on your choices."
 HOW_TO_PLAY_WINDOW_MECHANICS_ENTRY_COMBAT_TITLE: "COMBAT"
 HOW_TO_PLAY_WINDOW_MECHANICS_ENTRY_COMBAT_DESC: "The militaries of Darkest Hour attempt to more closely match up with the historical situation in the 1930's, and lead toward metas that reflect history. To that end, countries start with division templates that match the actual composition of those units in 1933. \n\nSome countries may have more work to do to reform their military than others, but that means unique challenges for each nation. On the flipside, a country which struggles to gain army experience won't be stuck with garbage templates against a country that has been at war throughout the 30s. Related to flavor, unit namelists have been expanded to give more accurate names for units.\n\n§YOther things to note:§!\n\n- Historical division composition will be the best. Triangular infantry divisions with a 4 battalion artillery regiment (situationally substituting one medium artillery battalion for an AA, AT, or heavy artillery battalion) is best.\n\n- Terrain type affects combat width, and different infantry battalion types have different combat widths. If you want to get the maximum combat width in narrow terrain like desert or jungle, light infantry is the way to go; shock infantry divisions will still fit in the slightly wider urban terrain.\n\n- Battalion and support company manpower and equipment requirements have been changed to reflect reality. Your support units will take up more manpower in most cases, and artillery battalions are now actually battalions rather than the vanilla battalion/regiment hybrid. Now the decision to add support units may actually hinge on whether you have enough manpower.\n\n- A lot of conditional triggers have been added to unit namelists, so your units will now change names as appropriate based on focuses, technology, or other situations. And new namelists will appear when they should.\n\n- New 'free' templates are no longer tied to the technology tree. Now events and focuses will grant division templates where they make sense. This also means that depending on your country, you are probably going to have to decide what types of specialist divisions you want to invest your experience points in, and fight with less than ideal unit compositions in some cases.\n\n- Reserve forces are now held in reserve. Units not called up until wartime are no longer available on the map at scenario start. You will be able to call them to active duty when your situation allows it, but you will not have the ability to pre-position them or exercise them fulltime.\n\n- Countries now have militias and other emergency defense units. Depending on the nation, a country losing a war may be able to call upon units formed from training commands, local area garrisons, as well as organized and hastily formed militias. Activating these forces will frequently be associated with some kind of malus. They may not be powerful enough to win the war, but they can buy a country time to reorganize or call in their allies."
 HOW_TO_PLAY_WINDOW_MECHANICS_ENTRY_CONSTRUCTION_SPEED_TITLE: "CONSTRUCTION SPEED"
 HOW_TO_PLAY_WINDOW_MECHANICS_ENTRY_CONSTRUCTION_SPEED_DESC: "§YHow does the construction speed work?§!\n\nIn Darkest Hour, construction speed is impacted by the unemployment mechanic. The unemployment that was brought about by the Great Depression can be reduced, and has 2 values.\n\n§YWhat is the impact of unemployment?§!\n\nThe values are the % of unemployment and the impact of the unemployment. For example, Italy has 30% unemployment, but 0% impact. So this will increase the base value by 0%. At the same time, France, who has less unemployment, undergoes a harder impact, with 150%.\n\n§YWhat are the other changes?§!\n\nWe have also reworked the construction system, by reducing the maximum amount of civilian factories that is assigned for each building that is being constructed. In the base game there are 15 civilian factories for building, whereas in Darkest Hour, it has been reduced to 10 factories for each."
