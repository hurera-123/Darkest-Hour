 ROM_Agrarian_Society_4_desc: "The 1930 census shows us that a stunning 78.9% of our population live in rural villages, one of the highest rates in Europe, meaning that a massive portion of the population still live by working the fields and living in self-contained village economies in the same way their ancestors have for centuries before them...

 ROM_Shockwaves_of_the_Depression: "Shockwaves of The Depression"
 ROM_Shockwaves_of_the_Depression_desc: "Romania’s economy, following the American stock market, has had a significant relapse that put an end to the interwar modernizations. The years after the crash saw an ever increasing amount of economical recession peaking in 1931 with the Romanian banking crisis which saw many of the leading private banks in Romania closing, meanwhile the main Romanian export, agricultural products, saw a severe loss in value on the global market which in turn increased the value of bread by four times. The industry on the other hand was hit as well but not as severely due to its small size and the fact that most of its market was targeted for Romanian consumption but any further industrial developments will be halted as the rest of the economy will need to recover in order for the country to function."
