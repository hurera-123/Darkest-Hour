 GATHERING_STORM_name: "Gathering Storm"
 GATHERING_STORM_desc: "Jan. 1st, 1933 \nDark clouds gather on the horizon. The Great Depression has torn the politics of many of the world's nations asunder. Less than two years ago, Japan under the control of the Showa Emperor asserted it's supremacy over the Chinese warlords, invading Manchuria and installing their puppet - making its ambitions to take over the rest of China more than clear. In Germany, political instability and strife have been rampant for three years thanks to the economic conditions caused by the Great Depression, and the extreme Nazi NSDAP stands poised to achieve absolute power in the country, putting the Versailles treaty at risk. In Italy, the Birthplace of Fascism, 'Il Duce' Benito Mussolini has ruled with an iron fist for over a decade, rearming and preparing to enforce its territorial ambitions. The former Entente nations still lick their wounds from the Great Depression, unable to do anything but watch as the threat to world peace grows. \n\nAlthough a second Great War seems far off into the horizon, the outlook certainly does not seem good. Can the Old World Order consolidate its power again before it's too late, or will the new forces of the world rise to challenge the established powers?"

#### Country Descriptions - 1933
 GER_1933_desc: "It is clear that the German experiment at a functioning democracy has failed. In fact, a democratic body is gone in all but name - the combined effort of the Great Depression, war reparations, national humiliation and hatred of the system associated with it.\n\nAmidst all the anarchy, a new party ready to take power has emerged - National Socialist Workers Party led by Adolf Hitler, who promises that the indignities of 1918 will be avenged, and German peoples will finally gain their place among the great powers. Hitler is no stranger to strife, as he led the Beer Hall Putsch of 1923 in Munich, and has been waiting for another chance at power ever since.\n\nPresident Hindenburg is possibly the only force that stops the country from plunging into an open civil war. Even with his increasing popularity, however, Hindenburg is reluctant to give his power to such an extremism - and sadly, for the former army commander, time is running out, and his choice could impact not only Germany, but the entire world."
 ITA_1933_desc: "Despite a victory over the Austro-Hungarians, Italy ended the Great War unsatisfied. After an alliance with the Allied Powers in order to gain vast territories in the Alps, Dalmatia and the decaying Ottoman Empire, Italia was given far less than promised, inciting many to wonder why their sons had died for almost nothing.\n\nCombined with the Great Depression and failure of parliamentary democracy, the famous ‘March on Rome’ in 1922 caused Benito Mussolini and his new Fascist movement to gain power. Since then, he’s enjoyed broad support from both the masses and the Grand Council of Fascism. But some of his promises are unfulfilled, and the glow of a new regime is fading.\n\nAlthough surviving the economic meltdown intact, Mussolini’s - or Duce’s - Italy needs to modernize if it wants to take what it is owed. Be it colonies, coastline or cotton, Italia will need to expand her navy, army and industry in order to rival England or even become masters of the Mediterranean.\n\nDespite the current largely warm relations with the western democracies, Mussolini knows that sooner or later, he will have to choose. His choice will decide whether the fascist experiment will triumph, or lead to Italy’s darkest hour."
 FRA_1933_desc: "The French Republic, undisputed victor of the Great War, paid a tremendous price for its success. Although the reclamation of Alsace-Lorraine and destruction of the German war machine was a success, French manpower suffered immensely, prompting the rise of an anti-war sentiment that festers to this day, blocking any military action, without major repercussions.\n\nThe Great Depression has worsened the situation even more - the radical, pro-Soviet left is on the rise, the far-right leagues lay dissent in the streets of Paris, and due to the economic meltdown, Germany can't pay the reparations the Republic so desperately needs.\n\nMeanwhile, the Armée de Terre has not evolved compared to the rest of Europe, still stuck in the mud of the Great War. Outdated and ill-equipped, the anti-war movement and the devastated ranks, compund an already dire situation into full despair.\n\nNewly elected, the Paul-Boncour government has to tackle all this, immediately and simultaneously. France’s premierships have been quick and chaotic, and any mandate isn’t to last long. If the Republic wishes to remain one of the Great Powers of Europe, someone is going to have to right the sinking ship, and fast."
 ENG_1933_desc: "The United Kingdom never really recovered from 1918. Although victorious in the Great War, flowering independence movements, the long Great Depression, and the rise of fascism, all threaten Albion’s perch atop the powers of Europe, let alone the whole world.\n\nEconomically, various austerity programs have reduced government spending significantly. The army is underdeveloped and only just managing to contain a vast colonial empire, bursting at the seams. And while the Royal Navy remains the worldwide naval power, new modern warfare lessons are learned at a breakneck pace, and keeping that pace is expensive.\n\nBritish diplomats remain committed to peace, allying with the Italians and the French, despite the former’s hatred at London and the latter’s anti-war sentiments. With Germany in Europe and Japan in Asia, and all of Britain’s colonies in between, it will take all of the island nation’s might to maintain her power.\n\nWith both the King and Prime Minister MacDonald in ill-health, it seems that politicians and royalty, match their country. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland has been sickened and downtrodden for sometime and the path forward could lead to greatness, or their darkest hour."
 SOV_1933_desc: "Russia’s catastrophic defeat in the Great War, along with a brutal civil war, has led to the rise of the red banner over the nation. Lenin’s death in 1924 created a power struggle that would place Joseph Stalin as the leader of the Soviet Union. His grip over the nation is iron-tight, with political opponents and suspicious government members being removed from society and his cult of personality hailed as the “Man of Steel”.\n\nWhile the capitalist nations of the world reel from the devastating effects of the Great Depression, the Union pushes forward with rapid industrialization and mass collectivization, set out by the Five-Year Plans, in the hope that Russia will finally be able to catch up to the modern industrial powers. With his idea of “Socialism in One Nation”, Stalin seeks to consolidate and grow the strength of the Union alone, but how long this isolation can last is unknown.\n\nThe bear may be sleeping now, but one small disturbance could send the red waves crashing down upon those who dare stand in its way. Germany and Japan walk towards militarism and relations with the West are as low as ever. The USSR will watch wearily and defend mightily her Communist Ideas and Russia herself!"
 USA_1933_desc: "After years of prosperity under a series of Republican presidents, the American economy has finally burst, almost like a bubble. Although it began four years ago after the stock market collapse, the Great Depression is having a massive effect on American society. Work can’t be found, crop failures are normal, and inflation has exploded.\n\nHence, it is no surprise that President Herbert Hoover lost to his Democratic counterpart in November - although yet to be sworn in, Franklin Delano Roosevelt has already announced his policies of a ‘New Deal’ for the American people and bringing serious change to the economic principles of the United States.\n\nWhile still a very isolationist nation, the United States is being pulled into the international world. Japan’s aggressive policies and movements against China rely on American oil, and Europe is slowly becoming a powder-keg, emanating once again from Berlin. The Navy is sizable, but the Army is laughable. It will require a herculean effort to bolster America’s armed forces. \n\nRegardless of FDR’s success, the world is changing quickly, and the USA is about to be on the front row, whether they want to or not."
 JAP_1933_desc: "The Empire of Japan has seen its power increase exponentially in the last 100 years. Crippling the Russians at Tsushima in 1905, the capture of the German East Asian colonies brought new possessions, while still being cheated out of the lion's share by the rest of Allies.\n\nAs such, the end of close relations with the West has created a dramatic rise in nationalism. Japan’s ballot box is fading, quickly. Political radicals openly call for a return to total Imperial authority, assassinating and ousting anyone in their way.\n\nWhile Japan was the least affected by the global economic crises, the effects of the Shōwa Depression still linger on. The Zaibatsu, an industrial conglomerate, dominates the banking and heavy industry sectors.\n\nThe Army and Navy continue to defy each other, vying for the limited resources of the Empire.  The Kantō-gun buckles up for a great adventure into "Shina", and to eventually "unify the eight corners of the world', a physical manifestation of "Hakkō ichiu". The Navy wraps up with the first Maru Keikaku and is already planning to circumvent the Washington Naval Treaty.\n\nRegardless, it seems that the Rising Sun will play the central act when the curtain finally rises over Asia."
 CHI_1933_desc: "China has long been divided, even before the collapse of Qing rule. European powers exploited the weak nation, culminating in the failed Boxer Rebellion in 1900. Many were unsatisfied at the weak attempts to throw the foreigners out, leading to the Xinhai Revolution of 1911, replacing 2000 years of imperial rule with a republic led by Sun Yat-Sen. The Three Principles of the People set out by him – Nationalism, Democracy, and Socialism – are still adhered to by Chiang Kai-shek and his government, although to what extent is often argued, as he is regularly accused of acting as an authoritarian..\n\nTwo major problems face the nationalist government: the remaining divided China, and an ever aggressive Japan. With a state of civil war existing, primarily between the government in Nanjing and the Communists, warlords have risen up in various areas of China, making unification a long road ahead. And with Japan having taken advantage of this weakness to further its imperial ambitions, it is only a matter of time before the Rising Sun strikes to attempt to put the Tiger down once and for all."
 POL_1933_desc: "Like the phoenix itself, Poland rose from the ashes of two dead empires and a war that destroyed Europe. Almost immediately, the young republic was almost overrun, but the “Miracle on the Vistula'' saved it from the claws of Bolsheviks. And yet, even with the guidance of Marshal Pilsudski, the Rzeczpospolita remains on a knife’s edge.\n\nThe partitions brought nothing but stagnation. While industrialization began, and the economy picked up pace, any progress was destroyed by the Great Depression. Largely still rural, Poland will require significant investment to bolster it’s small industrial core.\n\nMeanwhile, the vultures gather. Germany angers at their nation being split by the “Polish Corridor” and fringe groups call for it’s retaking, by force if needed. The Soviets haven’t forgotten about the defeat in 1921, and yearn for a chance at revenge. Internally, the large Ukrainian minority finds itself in a foreign country as the flames of an independent Ukraine still burns hot.\n\nDespite alliances with France and Romania, Poland must find a path in a world ready to ignite. But should war come, the Polish people stand united and ready to defend their new nation, whatever the cost may be."
 ETH_1933_desc: "Ethiopia has enjoyed relative peace and stability over the past couple of decades, having remained neutral during the Great War and any other substantial conflicts. Its victory against Italy in 1896 has seen the nation manage to avoid colonization during the “Scramble for Africa”, where so much of the continent was taken by the European powers.\n\nBefore Haile Selassie was crowned emperor in 1930, Menelik II started the process to take Ethiopia into the modern world, with the construction of railways, schools, and hospitals, as well as beginning an electrification campaign. Addis Ababa was proclaimed as the new capital, known as the “New Flower”.\n\nEmperor Selassie is continuing the path of modernization set out by Menelik II, but Ethiopia still lags far behind any of the European nations that surround it, and this poses a major problem. Italy has not forgotten its embarrassing defeat, and Mussolini still eyes conquering Ethiopia to strengthen his support at home. The lion roars, but war could come sooner rather than later, and the nation will need to be just as prepared, more than ever."
