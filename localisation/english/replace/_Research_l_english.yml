###### Signal Company
 tech_signal_company: "Signal Company"
 tech_signal_company2: "Early Phone Communication"
 tech_signal_company2_desc: "As communication technology advanced throughout the Great War, it allowed for further advancements in the capabilities of the many nascent signal units around the world. Improved radio communications and early motorcycles have begun to phase out the old messenger pigeons, but the most significant advancement has been the use of proper phone lines between signal units. This gives our boys vital security, keeping our most important secrets out of the hands of unsavoury people."
 tech_signal_company3: "Information Assurance"
 tech_signal_company3_desc: "To better protect classified military secrets, signal troops have begun using advanced and cutting-edge cypher machines to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data sent between signal units. These ciphers are encrypted using codes that are often so advanced that the only way to crack them is to obtain the original code books, which our trust signal troops would never allow to fall into enemy hands."
 tech_signal_company4: "Radio Communication"
 tech_signal_company4_desc: "As radio and cypher technology advanced throughout the interwar period, it became widespread enough to be used as a standard means of inter-unit communications. Our troops no longer rely on antiquated messenger pigeons carrying handwritten communications that could be lost or fall into enemy hands. Instead, they use cutting-edge radio communications, which allows for much greater coordination between multiple units in a much shorter time frame."
 tech_signal_company5: "Network Management"
 tech_signal_company5_desc: "Now that our communication technology has enabled the near-instant coordination of multiple units, it has necessitated the introduction of communication hubs to manage the sheer volume of outgoing and incoming messages between signal units. These network hubs will greatly improve unit cohesion while also assisting in the compilation of the tidal wave of military intelligence delivered by our soldiers in the field."
 tech_signal_company6: "Radio Tower Installation"
 tech_signal_company6_desc: "While a portable radio and a signal officer or two may suffice for a small group of units communicating over a short distance, larger formations attempting to communicate over much greater distances will require something of higher calibre. The construction of radio towers near the headquarters of our various signal units will significantly increase efficiency and reduce burdens on an often overburdened communication network."

 # WW1 + Interwar Doctrines
 Twentieth_Century_Warfare: "20th Century Warfare"
 Twentieth_Century_Warfare_desc: "With the mobilization of the European powers, fullscale war has descended upon the continent. Around the globe, lessons are being learned about the new warfare of the 20th Century. Brutal, loud and unprincipled, gone are the days of marching in columns and flying the colors. New organizational structures and tactics are required if we wish to gain the advantage in this new era."
 Leading_by_Task: "Leading By Task"
 Leading_by_Task_desc: ""
 Leading_by_Order: "Leading By Order"
 Leading_by_Order_desc: ""
 Strongpoint: "Strongpoint"
 Strongpoint_desc: "All along the European plain, trenches stretch across the landscape. Rudimentary at first, these dugouts are allowing staging positions to be set up directly at the battlefield. The concept of strongpoints creates areas where supplies, communications and even artillery lines can be used to invade or fortify local sectors. A new doctrine is emerging along the front, and it’s 10 feet deep."
 Mass_Charge: "Mass Charge"
 Mass_Charge_desc: "While the war started at a breakneck pace, it has slowed to a crawl. In a bid to try and upend enemy positions, many commanders are using outdated mass infantry charges to cross the newly known No Man's Land. While the tactic has provided some limited success, we are bleeding casualties. Therefore, more men are required to bolster our divisions if we are to further this strategy."
 Static_Defence: "Static Defence"
 Static_Defence_desc: "Trench Warfare has now become the default doctrine of this terrible conflict. Day by day, lines are wired, supplies are cached and tunnelers are digging. It is becoming clear that widespread offensives will give nothing but blood and inches. Staying below ground, below the storm of lead, is providing a defense unlike any conflict before. A war of attrition has begun."
 Counterattack: "Counterattack"
 Counterattack_desc: "High Command has learned many lessons over the past months about offensive movements in defensive environments. Tunnelers are creating paths below the lead laden air, officers are finding breaks in the wires and artillery is creating literal walls of ordinance. Combining these tactics with immediate counterattacks is allowing our gains to be counted in miles rather than yards."
 Defence_In_Depth: "Defence In Depth"
 Defence_In_Depth_desc: "A deeper knowledge of fortification tactics is required to keep our armies in the conflict. Trenches are being designed snaking miles behind the battlefield. Pillboxes are deployed, artillery is emplaced and barbed wire is being unwrapped. The literal dirt beneath our feet is being gauged in its defensive properties. It’s no longer a static front, strategic depth is the path for total victory."
 Schwerpunkt: "Schwerpunkt"
 Schwerpunkt_desc: "In this bloody war of attrition, widespread offensives just lead to widespread casualties. All the largest battles drain the manpower of the involved nations. Instead, using a  focus point, or Schwepunkt, will bring tactical success. Every unit, company, officer and general are planning a single point of attack, even if risking other sectors. Concentrated spearheads will plow the enemy trenches."
 Separate_Arms_Force: "Separate Arms Force"
 Separate_Arms_Force_desc: "Technology marches right alongside the armies. A new metal machine, known as a tank, are able to traverse the deadly middleground and breakthrough trenches. Flying vehicles, aircraft, provide hourly reconnaissance. Artillery grows larger in range and caliber. They have found their niche in this conflict, and while tactics are lacking, their individual contributions cannot be ignored."
 Combined_Arms_Effort: "Combined Arms Effort"
 Combined_Arms_Effort_desc: "Aircraft send reports on successful artillery barrages. Infantry hug the tanks closely across No Man’s Land. Slowly but surely, these individual machines of war have become entangled with modern battlefield tactics. While the trenches of old are still the default measure of war, these technologies are once again modifying the doctrine. Metal is replacing dirt as the scenery of combat."
 Specialized_Branch_Tactical_Experience: "Specialized-Branch Tactical Experience"
 Specialized_Branch_Tactical_Experience_desc: "This terrible war is now in its final death throes. We have learned so much in the last few years of the conflict. Our armed forces have become their own fleshed out branches. Ground based infantry, mechanized forces, blue water navies and airborne fleets are now expertly bringing the bloodshed to a conclusion. This doctrine is the future, whether a bright or dark one."
 Cross_Branch_Tactical_Experience: "Cross-Branch Tactical Experience"
 Cross_Branch_Tactical_Experience_desc: "This terrible war is now in its final death throes. We have learned so much in the last few years of the conflict. Our armed forces have integrated heavily between the individual branches. Naval forces work in tandem with our airborne fleets, while ground based infantry ride along or just behind our mechanized machines. This doctrine is the future, whether a bright or dark one."
 Beyond_Trench_Warfare: "Beyond Trench Warfare"
 Beyond_Trench_Warfare_desc: "The Great War has finally concluded. Millions have perished in the largest conflict in human history.  Industrialized, entrenched and explosive, battlefield warfare has been transformed forever. So much has changed, and many have yet to fully understand what the doctrine of war will be beyond the trenches. While the ink is still wet on the treaties, some wonder if this is really an end or just a beginning."
