#  Finland Leaders
######################################################################
 Pehr_Evind_Svinhufvud_desc: "When one thinks of a politician, one thinks of someone who serves his own interests. Either that or the interests of someone else. That usually ends up with the people suffering under the politician, and never getting the basic necessities of life.\nBut this politician is not the typical rank and file politician. Oh no, not him. He’s a unique brand of politician, one willing to throw himself for his country. You see, he saw the horrors of war, the carnage man created during the Independence War. Yet he also saw the bravery of his fellow Finn, inspiring him to do the same. He would join militia after militia, serving diligently against the Red Menace. After the war, when the Soviets degenerated into the totalitarian nightmare, he knew....\nHe was right all along.\nBut not just against the left, he was against any form of radicalism, for the country was young, and he would rather die than let it become a socialist hell hole or a fascist police state. When Mäntsälä happened, he made sure that the coup was foiled, but not through bullets, but rather through words. Those words helped to show the rebels the truth, and with just one speech, they dispersed.\nNow it has been nearly 2 decades since the country was set free from the Russian yoke, and he has something to show for it. Regent, Prime Minister, and now President. Truly, this is not your typical politician."
 Kyosti_Kallio_desc: "Time. It is a linear concept. Always in one direction, never changing, never being changed. So one must use it wisely, or else they will have lived a life unfulfilled.\nNot this man. Not Kyösti Kallio.\nBorn to a small family in the Duchy of Finland, this man would eventually become something more than a simple citizen, more than a politician. Instead, he would become a symbol. To the Finnish people.\nKallio would find himself in a perilous situation following the liberation of the country from Provisional Rule. Mainly, where would the country go? Would it become a socialist den of debauchery? Or would it thrive in the flames of war?\nKallio, while a member of the agrarian league, saw the destruction the Reds had done, and instead decided to use the law to suppress these maniacs. \nYet he wasn’t just a man of the law, for he was able to be president multiple times in the ’20s, managing to steer the country towards a more prosperous path.\nKallio has shown us that time can be used more efficiently, achieving many things in such a small amount of time.\nTime may be linear, but it is certainly not uneventful."
 Risto_Ryti_desc: "Finance, and politics. Now normally, those two things should not mix, since the times that happened resulted in less than savory results. Corruption, nepotism, and manipulation of the government to suit one’s needs. However, when the two mix in just the right way, they can produce some spectacular results.\nEnter Risto Ryti. A man who was more than a hideaway during the Independence War, he was able to rise through the government. Yet this was not because of connections, or by his political knowledge, but rather, but his acumen in finance and economics. When he was 23, he was appointed as finance minister under Juho Vennola, managing the economy with precision and efficiency.\nNothing would trump that until he became the governor of the national bank. \nThis one appointment would be his moment.\nHe managed to get the country running after Black Monday, stabilizing the economy and showing the world that Finland was not the backwater it was seen to be. Let this man be an example to all of us of the true strength of the Finnish people, and that we are not the backwater we once were!"
 Carl_Gustaf_Emil_Mannerheim_desc: "Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim born 4th of June 1867 was a Finnish military leader born of a German-Swedish noble family, nevertheless he was no less loyal to Finland than any other man that could trace his heritage in Finland for hundreds of years. He was a key figure in the great struggle for the existence of Finland as a self-determined state born of the dying Russian Empire and defender of democratic, republican ideals in spite of the Bolshevik revolution.\n\nMannerheim was, as a young man, trained extensively in the art of warfare on horseback, in fact throughout most of his military record in the Imperial Army he fought with and lead cavalry corps, from being part of the Chevalier Guard Regiment to commanding the Guards Cavalry Brigade; Not only was he highly capable in warfare he also had extensive knowledge and experience in on-the-field intelligence-gathering and espionage after several spent in Asia undercover for the Russian government.\nThe true test of his mettle and abilities came in 1918 with the Bolshevik revolution of Russia spreading itself in the newly formed independent state of Finland, where he didn't only fight the Finnish Red Guard but also remnants of the Russian Imperial Army. Despite the initial situation of advantage for the red guard Mannerheim managed to weather it through his tactical prowess and help from the German Empire. At the end of the day, following months of bloody fighting, the war was over and Mannerheim stood victorious.\n\nDuring the inter-war years, Mannerheim did not assume any political office and did not join any political parties. Although he had his sympathies for the right-wing and did not truly believe in democracy he pursued a policy of nonpartisan often trying to reconcile the right and left-wing in order to face adversities as one nation, united.\nThis policy has borne its fruits as the public opinion of him shifted into that of a uniter and a truly neutral party amongst the bickering of the political parties and as of 1933, he became the Field Marshal of Finland. As the Red Bear rises in the East and the Black Eagle in South Finland's position seems more precarious than ever and it is no doubt that Mannerheim will fill a central role in what is to be this nation's future."

 FIN_Politics.1.t: "Northern Flank: Finland"
 FIN_Politics.1.d: "German diplomats have approached us with the offer to take over rightful Finnish territory. Karelia, the Kola Peninsula and Olonetsk are offered for our unconditional membership to the Axis faction. Their reason for abandoning the lands seems to evolve around the harsh winter conditions. Ah well, their problem. If we accept we are expected to function as Germany's northern flank, safeguarding the north of their new possessions in the east."
 FIN_Politics.1.A: "We Gladly Accept"
 FIN_Politics.1.B: "We don't need Germany's help"

 FIN_Winter_War.1.t: "Soviet Demands Arrive!"
 FIN_Winter_War.1.d: "After much political and diplomatic intrigue, the Soviet demands - in a formal written format have been handed over to Juho Kusti Paasikivi, our representative in Moscow, who has forwarded the same to Helsinki.\n\nThe demands call for the shifting of the frontier between the USSR and Finland on the Karelian Isthmus westward to a point 30 kilometres east of Viipuri, our second-largest city, to the line between Koivisto and Lipola, a very heavy demand indeed.\n\nIn addition, they have requested us to destroy all existing fortifications on the Karelian Isthmus. As per their note we would also cede to them the islands of Suursaari, Tytärsaari, and Koivisto in the Gulf of Finland. In the north, the Soviets have demanded the Kalastajasaarento peninsula. Furthermore, we would also need to \"lease\" the Hanko Peninsula to the Soviets for thirty years, and permit them to establish a military base there.\n\nTo compensate for our territories they have in exchange offered to cede Repola and Porajärvi from Eastern Karelia, an area twice as large as the territories demanded from us.\n\nTheir demands are by far- large and very demanding, despite the lands they offer to us in exchange, we stand to lose a great amount of our prestige and sovereignty. It would take considerable deliberations and discussion for our response to their demands."
 FIN_Winter_War.1.A: " Aah.... mikä ongelma. Accept their demands"
 FIN_Winter_War.1.B: "Aah.... mikä ongelma. Propose a Counteroffer"

 FIN_Winter_War.2.t: "Treaty of Leningrad"
 FIN_Winter_War.2.d: "Peace has been maintained as the latest round of talks between our countries has finally bore fruit. While the Finnish side had been adamant about maintaining its \"territorial integrity\", the Finnish representative Juho Kusti Paasikivi eventually communicated to Moscow that the Finnish government had finally accepted the Soviet demands in the entirety.\n\nAnd in a momentous event yesterday an agreement was signed in Leningrad, with many international journalists attending. Despite the other conflicts raging all over the world, this treaty has caught a lot of international attention. Hans Frederick Arthur Schoenfeld, the American ambassador to Finland communicated his regret to the Finnish government on behalf of the Office of the President of the United States of America, which had termed the whole thing as \"a shameful affair, wherein a democratic country was forced to sign away its territories under the threat of a military action\". But many people, including the diplomats of our 2 countries welcome this development.\n\nThe final agreement that was ratified by the 2 parties contains clauses which facilitates territorial exchanges and other minor exchanges, mainly by Finland to allow for a greater buffer zone between Leningrad and the border along with reciprocal exchanges from the Soviet side to compensate the territorial losses of Finland."
 FIN_Winter_War.2.A: "To a long friendship."

 FIN_Winter_War.3.t: "Treaty of Leningrad Signed"
 FIN_Winter_War.3.d: "[ROOT.GetNewsIcon]\nWhile talks and diplomacy have failed elsewhere in Europe and the World. The Governments of the Republic of Finland and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics have finally come to an understanding and signed the Treaty of Leningrad.\n\nThe Treaty has facilitated territorial exchanges and other exchanges, mainly by Finland to allow for a greater buffer zone between Leningrad and the border along with reciprocal exchanges from the Soviet side to compensate the territorial losses of Finland.\n\nWhile many have labeled the whole process behind the agreement as a situation in which Finland was held at gunpoint, wherein the government was forced to accept the treaty. With international responses still incoming and divided, if anything is clear, it is that peace has been preserved and any threat of conflict averted."
 FIN_Winter_War.3.A: "Snow storms will rise on both sides of the new border."

 FIN_Winter_War.4.t: "Finnish Delegation Arrives"
 FIN_Winter_War.4.d: "After our initial diplomatic exchanges with the Finnish government, a proper delegation that will be representing their interests has arrived in Moscow. It seems the Finnish have been a bit apprehensive of our initial offer and demands and the delegation has made a counteroffer to us.\n\nThe Delegation, with the necessary approval from their government has rejected our initial offer, but still seems to be receptive to the idea of giving us some land. Their delegation have outright ignored our demands of the islands of Suursaari, Tytärsaari, and Koivisto in the Gulf of Finland, the Kalastajasaarento peninsula and even our request of the \"lease\" of the Hanko Peninsula, and permission to establish a military base there has been rejected. They have even rejected our request for the destruction of all existing fortifications on the Karelian Isthmus, a provocative stubbornness on their part.\n\nBut apart from this, their counteroffer sympathises with our need of land to have a larger buffer between the border and Leningrad, and henceforth have shown their willingness to hand over the municipality of Terijoki in Karelia.\n\nTo summarise their counteroffer: we barely get anything that we demand, and it is obvious they are simply stalling the talks. While they offer us token land, their reserves have been called up for \"additional refresher\" training, a second nature of these fascist snakes indeed, call up the Army for everything. It has now become obvious that we need to use some \"other means\" to enforce our demands."
 FIN_Winter_War.4.A: "Mobilise the Red Army"

 FIN_Winter_War.5.t: "Negotiations Break Down"
 FIN_Winter_War.5.d: "Today the Finnish delegation which had arrived in Moscow, which originally came to discuss a counteroffer in response to our territorial demands hastily departed back to Helsinki, signifying a breakdown of talks.\n\nThe Finnish Delegation, headed by Juho Kusti Paasikivi was adamant in their insistence on their \"territorial integrity\" and their wish to safeguard it. Their counteroffer was a token offer of the transfer of the municipality of Terijoki, a complete inconsideration to our original demands.\n\nBut the Finnish in their arrogant stubbornness have refused to even consider our demands. It is obvious there is no point in shuttling of diplomatic envoys to and from Helsinki.\n\nApart from our issues of territories, the Finnish people are governed by a deceitful administration of fascist scum, who seek to oppress the Finnish workers, and hence their welfare and our aim of furthering the socialist cause must also be considered in our plan of action.\n\nOur future plan of action is to say, \"resolute\" and \"definitive\" in nature which would seek for the liberation of Finnish people as well as securing our territorial interests."
 FIN_Winter_War.5.A: "The white lands of the Finns will soon run red"

 FIN_Winter_War.6.t: "Shelling of Mainila"
 FIN_Winter_War.6.d: "Now it is more than clear enough that our demands to Finland must be enforced. However we are still bound by nonsensical treaties and are also a member state of the League of Nations, and hence any military action from our side must be justified.\n\nAccordingly we have planned out a false flag operation wherein our town of Mainila will be shelled by our own guns, with supposed \"casualties\" as well, all of which we'll portray as an act of Finnish aggression. The whole \"incident\" will provide us with a casus belli, which we'll use to withdraw from our existing non aggression pact with Finland. Thereafter our troops will ready themselves for a full scale invasion of Finland, while the terrain might provide us with some difficulties, our overwhelming superiority in quantity as well as quality will guarantees us a quick victory over the meagre force the Finns might be able to assemble against us.\n\nAs of this moment, with war raging all over Europe, most countries will be preoccupied with their own issues to care what happens in our frigid corner of the world, and hence the present state of international affairs provides us with an opportune moment to stage such an operation.\n\nAs we speak, artillery guns are being aimed towards Mainila, and simply await you final order."
 FIN_Winter_War.6.A: "Fire Away!!!!!"
 
 FIN_Winter_War.66.t: "Shelling of Mainila"
 FIN_Winter_War.66.d: "So the political dance has ended, the Soviets have seemingly shelled their own positions and blamed us for the same. Such a ridiculous claim is physically impossible as we have no guns at such a proximity to the border capable of such an action. Yesterday, our border posts heard seven shots being fired from the Soviet side and detected them landing approximately 800 metres from the border, on the town of Mainila. While there have been \"casualties\" on the Soviet side, our border posts believe that none was affected in anyway.\n\nThe recent happenings have soured our relations with the Soviets. Undoubtedly the whole incident was staged by the Soviets themselves, as earlier the Soviets had conducted border exercises which were contingent on aggression on Mainila.\n\nWhile we have rejected the false accusations, the Soviets are still vehement in their allegations, even rejecting our offer to have a third party to investigate the whole incident. While the future remains uncertain, we must begin preparations to defend our country."
 FIN_Winter_War.66.A: "We very well might need to shell Mainila for real"

 FIN_Winter_War.7.t: "Soviets Withdraw from Non-Aggression Pact"
 FIN_Winter_War.7.d: "Whatever hopes we had of bilateral talks defusing the current situation were proven false yesterday, when the Soviet Union \"irrevocably withdrew from its obligations\" as mentioned in the Soviet–Finnish Non-Aggression Pact of 1932.\n\nThe Soviet–Finnish Non-Aggression Pact was a non-aggression treaty signed in 1932 by our representatives and that of the Soviet Union, wherein both parties guaranteed to respect each other's borders, with an agreement to stay neutral in each other's conflicts and disputes were promised to be solved peacefully and neutrally. The pact was extended to December 31, 1945 on April 7, 1934, with the extension being signed in Moscow by our Foreign Minister Aarno Yrjö-Koskinen and the Soviet Foreign Minister Maxim Litvinov.\n\nThe Soviets have cited the recent \"shelling\" of Mainila as the reason for their unilateral withdrawal from the pact, a absurd allegation. According to Article 5 of the pact, both parties are supposed to call for a joint commission to examine such a happening, despite our repeated pleas, the Soviet Union has refused to allow for the formation of one, much less investigate the \"incident\".\n\nWith their withdrawal from the pact, it seems that conflict is imminent, the Soviet Union for all its propagandist image of having a mighty military will very soon learn just how stubbornly a Finn is willing to fight for his homeland."
 FIN_Winter_War.7.A: "Mobilise the Civil Guard."

 FIN_Winter_War.8.t: "Bombers over Helsinki!"
 FIN_Winter_War.8.d: "Last night, a large wave of VVS aircraft descended upon our capital of Helsinki. In what was supposed to be a massive \"air raid\" by the Soviets, our Capital was largely unaffected by the bombs. Though large in scale, poor accuracy by the bombers, existing bomb shelters across the city, our relatively accurate anti aircraft gun fire and prompt action by our Civil Guard prevented any significant loss to human life. But the population is still shocked in the aftermath of the thousands of the bombs being dropped on the city, with some unfortunate among the casualties. Though unknown, the Civil Guard first responders estimate only a few hundred were directly affected by the bombings.\n\nWhen asked by international diplomats to not bomb any Finnish cities, the Soviet spokesperson claimed the Tupolev SBs were \"dropping food to the starving Finns\", our countrymen have jokingly dubbed the Soviet bombs as \"Molotov's Breadbaskets\". \n\nWhile the damage is in itself of little concern, the intention and attitude behind the bombings is. The Soviets use of such a force indicates their willingness to escalate their Military operations to such a massive scale, as we speak the Soviets troops that have crossed the border seem to be resolute. But the \"Sisu\", an unparalleled tenacity and determination evident in the Finns will make even the \"Steam Roller\" run out of its \"Steam\"."
 FIN_Winter_War.8.A: "Load up the Bofors AAs"

 FIN_Winter_War.9.t: "Finland at War!"
 FIN_Winter_War.9.d: "War has finally reached our country, for long did we think that our homeland would be safe from the the chaos and conflict raging across the world, but unfortunately we have been proven wrong. Our deceitful neigbour, the USSR, losing all rationale and sense has attacked us. As we speak thousands of Soviet troops are crossing the border to wage war backed by hundreds of aircraft which have already begun bombing our capital.\n\nIn this moment of desperation, Risto Ryti has stepped up to lead our country, under his guidance we will endure and prevail over the Reds. The Civil Guard is being mobilised, our Army is taking up defensive positions, AA guns and searchlights are being operated and last but not the least, perhaps most crucially-our envoys have been dispatched to international support and aid to pressure the Soviets, as even our strong people cannot indefinitely hold out against an endless horde of attackers.\n\nThe Soviets are using headlong armoured charges to try and breakthrough our defenses, but our brave soldiers are stubbornly standing their ground, resorting to all manners of improvised weapons, using crowbars and logs to jam the wheels of their tanks, and some frontline soldiers have begun using glass bottles filled with flammable liquids and with a simple hand-lit fuse to cover enemy vehicles in fire. Jokingly they are being called \"Molotov Cocktails\", and in the words of a private they are \"a drink to go with Molotov breadbaskets\". This joke goes on to show the morale of our troops, though greatly outnumbered, we will more than make up for them in our fighting spirit."
 FIN_Winter_War.9.A: "This one's for you, Comrade Molotov."

 FIN_Winter_War.10.t: "The League of Nations Expels USSR"
 FIN_Winter_War.10.d: "[ROOT.GetNewsIcon]\nIn an unprecedented move, the League of Nations has officially revoked the membership status of the USSR and expelled it. An unnamed League of Nations official was quoted as saying \"The Soviet Union has exhibited a flagrant violation of the Covenant of the League of Nations\". The said \"violation\" refers to the ongoing Soviet attack on its Arctic neighbour Finland.\n\nThough a very strong response, most diplomats agree this \"expulsion\" is of no consequence, as the Soviet attack goes unchecked. For long the League had been criticised for its inaction in the past, and it seems even its firmest action can do anything but stop such aggressive actions.\n\nMany have declared the whole affair as the \"last nail in the League's coffin\", citing that it has utterly failed in its goals and objectives. It is completely paralysed while conflicts rage all across the world."
 FIN_Winter_War.10.A: "It wasn’t good while it lasted either."

 FIN_Winter_War.11.t: "Establishment of the Finnish Democratic Republic"
 FIN_Winter_War.11.d: "In a Formal Event held in Helsinki, Marshal Kliment Voroshilov, Commander of the Occupational Forces in Finland, handed over control of the city to Otto Wille Kuusinen, the Prime Minister of the Finnish Democratic Republic. The symbolic handover of the city was intended to represent the return of the national governance back to the Finns, or in actuality represent the establishment of a new communist administration that would replace the previous one, which was dissolved soon after the Finnish defeat.\n\nThough initially they stood their ground, using innovative tactics, but the Finnish defense and resistance was eventually obliterated in the face of our overwhelming military might. Our troops had soon after swept through the majority of the Finnish population centres and cities and established firm control over the majority of the country.\n\nAmong its initial charges, the new country will \"dispose\" of its traitors and begin repairing the damage caused by the small but intensive war with us, particularly some of the damage that Helsinki suffered in our air raids. The Finnish have ceded us some land, but their territorial \"integrity\" has been largely untouched. One thing is assured, Leningrad is secure from any possible attack for the foreseeable future and we have gained a valuable ally in our neighbour."
 FIN_Winter_War.11.A: "A triumph of the socialist cause."
 FIN_Winter_War.11.B: "Bitter peace"

 FIN_Winter_War.12.t: "Loss in the Winter War"
 FIN_Winter_War.12.d: ""
 FIN_Winter_War.12.A: "Bitter peace"

 FIN_Coastal_Batteries: "Coastal Batteries"
 FIN_Coastal_Batteries_desc: "If we fail at making our fleets stronger, we need protection for our coasts. Construction of coastal forts will be important against the enemy naval invasions. We should prioritize making coastal forts in our cities and our ports. The enemy will have a tough time breaking our steel and stone batteries."
 
 FIN_Aland_Naval_Base: "Åland Naval Base"
 FIN_Aland_Naval_Base_desc: "In order to make a big fleet, we need dockyards where we can produce the mighty Finnish navies. Åland is a perfect place to begin building the dockyards and start the production of our capital ships and start conquering the seas. The Åland engineers are the most advanced ones in our country and shall provide the perfect plans to build our ships."
 
 FIN_Backup_Lines: "Backup Lines"
 FIN_Backup_Lines_desc: "Defense in Depth is theorized to be a much more effective tactic than a linear, seemingly impenetrable line. For such reason high command has ordered the construction of secondary defense lines to slow down any advances through the Karelian Isthmus as it is the shortest path to our Capital from the Soviet border."
 
 FIN_The_Salpa_Line: "Build the Salpa Line"
 FIN_The_Salpa_Line_desc: "The defenses we have built so far heavily focus on the Karelian Isthmus and it is no doubt the wise choice as all of our intelligence indicates that a Soviet attack will most likely be through that attack vector. The rest of the country however remains mostly exposed. Despite the poor infrastructure and terrain of the north these areas are still poorly manned and are fertile grounds for a Soviet offensive. It is necessary to entrench our positions with a line that spans the length of the largely undefended border. This line won’t be supported by as many secondary lines for a proper defense in depth but for the environment it will be built in a high concentration attack is unlikely."
 
 FIN_Doctrine_of_National_Defense: "Doctrine of National Defense"
 FIN_Doctrine_of_National_Defense_desc: "Our country needs more experienced soldiers in it’s armies, by improving our doctrines our war goals will be more successful and the soldiers will carry out their orders with more efficiency. The might of the Finnish army is yet to be seen. No army shall stand in our way when fully militarized."
 
 FIN_Ski_Troops: "Ski Troops"
 FIN_Ski_Troops_desc: "Most of our country is covered in snow for a large part of the year; some areas are even in a permanent state of snow. This is both a blessing and a curse for our defenses. The snow will confuse and slow down the enemy severely as they advance in our territory, but it also prevents us from responding to breaches in a timely manner due to poor infrastructure. High Command has answered to this “hole” in our defenses by providing several light infantry regiments with Skis. These tools will allow our troops to move along the icy and snowy terrain with extreme agility, certainly faster than any land vehicle in the same conditions, outmaneuvering any enemy incursions through our lines."

It is the duty of not only the state but all Finnish citizens to do what it is in their power to support our troops through morale or through materials regardless. When the men of our nation have their wives and daughters behind them they will fight twice as hard and when their sons see their fathers fighting for their nation they will follow in their footsteps. They will accomplish the ultimate sacrifice, and they will be forever honored by the people of this nation."
 
 FIN_Import_Artilery: "Improve Artillery"
 FIN_Import_Artilery_desc: "Most of our army still relies on mortars and smoothbore artillery pieces from the Great War. Their potential to be deadly is not to be doubted but the fact of the matter is that they are cumbersome and largely inaccurate. In the era of ever increasing precision falling behind is not acceptable. A contest for Suomi’s next standard use artillery piece has been drafted up, the conditions include: light weight, rifled barrel, treaded rubber tires, ability to be transported easily by horse, vehicle or train and most importantly to be within the industrial production capabilities of our nation."
 
 FIN_New_Service_Rifles: "New Service Rifles"
 FIN_New_Service_Rifles_desc: "Since the Great War, the FDF have used the Old Russian M1891 rifle and it has served us well but the time has come for a new design. The M1891 is still a good rifle, just not up to modern standards. As such our engineers have designed a new rifle, a carbine, that will cover all the duties the old rifle has but at the same time making it lighter, smaller and easier to produce."
 
 FIN_Concentrated_Fire: "Concentrated Fire"
 FIN_Concentrated_Fire_desc: "Our artillery corps is not as numerous as we’d like them to be and due to this we’ll have to make a workaround to increase the effectiveness of our already existing artillery pieces. The solution to this dilemma would be the concentration of fire doctrine: instead of using artillery all along the front, thus causing little or no damage, artillery fire should be coordinated into a single cone of fire to ensure maximum damage on the enemy lines, whether they are on the offensive or defensive."

We have an ancestral duty to protect the Scandinavian people, whether they fight with us or against us. \n\nAs we aim to redefine our military structure as a whole, we must instill this doctrine into the hearts of our men, so they know whom they fight and why they fight.

This means, of course, that women must be able to support our army in any way they can, through service in hospitals, anti-air, social work and other auxiliary duties. \n\nIn this mind, we must expand an institution that has existed since our independence in 1918; the Lotta Svärd. The women’s auxiliary corps has served us well in the past, but to fulfill the needs of a growing army and a growing world, they must be expanded. Through propaganda and incentives, we aim to double its numbers in the coming years, so that we may be ready to face any threat knowing our wives are at our sides."
