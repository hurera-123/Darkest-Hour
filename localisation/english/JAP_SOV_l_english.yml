 JAP_SOV_Border_Conflict.1.t: "The Halhamiao Incident"
 JAP_SOV_Border_Conflict.1.d: "A Mongolian cavalry unit ambushed a nearby Manchurian patrol stationed around the Khalkhin Temple yesterday morning. Several Japanese military advisors were overseeing the patrol setting up base along the lines when the ambush caught them off guard, killing the Manchurian soldiers near the cavalry force as well as several Japanese advisors and volunteers.\n\nThe Mongolian attack force was counter-attacked with a machine gun, resulting in severe casualties and injuries for the Mongolian cavalry unit. A few dozen Manchurian soldiers and Japanese volunteers were killed, along with one officer and a few commanders, while 23 to 40 Mongolian cavalry riders were killed, with many more injured from the estimated 90-man cavalry regiment."
 JAP_SOV_Border_Conflict.1.A: "Bolshevik puppets..."
 JAP_SOV_Border_Conflict.1.B: "Imperial scum..."

 JAP_SOV_Border_Conflict.2.t: "Clashes at Lake Khanka"
 JAP_SOV_Border_Conflict.2.d: "For months, Soviet and Japanese forces have clashed near Lake Khasan and Khanka. These skirmishes have amounted to little more than open warfare between the two, but only a lack of will in both Tokyo and Moscow to engage in a larger fight has kept them localized. Despite this, the Japanese have not fared well, despite the recent Soviet purges that prompted their attacks. The Japanese were able to push the Soviets back to less advantageous positions, but the sheer weight of Soviet arms forced them to abandon their new fortifications. The combination of artillery, aerial bombing, and ground offensives was simply too much for Japan to handle.\n\nThe Red Army suffered hundreds of casualties, more than the Japanese, and had great difficulty pushing them back across the border. This has prompted Moscow to conduct a thorough examination of the local forces' shortcomings in the battle. They have identified numerous points of failure, such as inadequate infrastructure and communications. Vasily Blyukher, the local commander, has been blamed for everything, and he has been dispatched. That, however, will not solve the problems; much more work is required before the Japanese return."
 JAP_SOV_Border_Conflict.2.A: "Let's hope this doesn't spiral."
 JAP_SOV_Border_Conflict.2.B: "Let's hope this doesn't spiral."

 JAP_SOV_Border_Conflict.3.t: "Suifenho Border Incident"
 JAP_SOV_Border_Conflict.3.d: "Deep in the darkness of the Manchurian forests, amid the silent, yet eloquent, flow of a nearby creek, a force of about 9 Japanese and 32 Manchurian soldiers engaged in setting up an outpost 20 kilometres north of Suifenho, in Manchurian territory. They had planned to set up camp here to monitor the area, were it not for a sudden disturbance by the hidden Soviet force, waiting for the time to strike. About 50 Soviet soldiers advanced towards the Manchurian-Japanese battalion and opened fire upon them with their rifles and 5 machine guns. The chaotic clash, occurring near the Manchurian-Soviet border, resulted in 4 Manchurian deaths and 5 more injured. A Manchu foreign affairs representative issued a strongly worded verbal protest to a Soviet Consul because of this, and as of now, the IJA’s Kwantung Army intelligence officers have been sent to investigate the situation."
 JAP_SOV_Border_Conflict.3.A: "They must apologise for this!"
 JAP_SOV_Border_Conflict.3.B: "They were the aggressors!"

 JAP_SOV_Border_Conflict.4.t: "Disturbance at Buir Lake"
 JAP_SOV_Border_Conflict.4.d: "On a cold crisp last night, a Manchurian army unit engaged in a reconnaissance project southwest of Buir Lake in the deep foreboding forests of Manchuria to relay intel and info of the region. They ran into a Mongolian party that was in the area in full secrecy up until this point. The Mongolian force engaged and clashed with the Manchurian Army Unit, resulting in the capture of ten Mongolian soldiers. Almost a week later, 60 vengeful truck-borne Mongolian troops were sighted by the army unit. Many thought about why they were here, some guessing retribution for the Manchurians capturing the 10 Mongolian soldiers. Regardless, the Mongolians attacked but were repulsed, at the cost of 3 Manchurian deaths. On that very same day, somewhere in Brunders, Mongolian soldiers had attempted to drive out Manchurian forces located there three times in the day, and then 3 times again at night, but proved to be futile for the Mongolians. It was reported that there were more, smaller attempts to dislodge the Manchurians from their outposts with the Mongolians this time utilizing their airplanes for recon duty. But they too failed as the Japanese armies stationed there guarded the outposts with both sides suffering only a few casualties."
 JAP_SOV_Border_Conflict.4.A: "A test passed, but bigger ones approach."
 JAP_SOV_Border_Conflict.4.B: "The Japanese better watch themselves!"

 JAP_SOV_Border_Conflict.5.t.JAP: "Soviet Border Tensions Heighten"
 JAP_SOV_Border_Conflict.5.t.SOV: "Manchurian Border Tensions Heighten"
 JAP_SOV_Border_Conflict.5.d.JAP: "Near the large rivers that form the border between Russia and Manchuria, some fishy activity has been sighted and reported. Soviet troops have been crossing the border, disrupting activities and sabotaging outposts for reasons we don't know yet. This shows that we need to amplify border security between us and them for the security of our nation.\n\nWe’ve been getting reports that have confirmed what we have feared all along: The insidious Bolsheviks are raiding us! They’ve been disrupting outposts, and exchanged plenty of fire between our troops! Our nation is being threatened by the spectre of a red bear looking to take our nation by storm and establish their puppet government on Japanese soil! For the empire, we should increase border security and if these Bolshevik dogs dare to attack us, we shall show them what the spirit of the samurai tastes like!\n\nBut for now, we’ll wait and see what will happen next."
 JAP_SOV_Border_Conflict.5.d.SOV: "Near the large rivers that form the border between Russia and Manchuria, some fishy activity has been sighted and reported. Japanese troops have been crossing the border, disrupting activities and sabotaging outposts for reasons we don't know yet. This shows that we need to amplify border security between us and them for the security of our nation.\n\nThese fascist and capitalist scum who dare threaten the revolution must be fought against! They stand everything against what we stand for, and are an obstacle to achieving our vision of a glorious socialist future! Pre-emptive action must be taken to stop them dead in their tracks, and only then will our glorious union be free from the decadent ways of Japan. For now though, we should send some of our troops on the border to make sure they don’t topple us if that's their goal.\n\nBut for now, we’ll wait and see what will happen next."
 JAP_SOV_Border_Conflict.5.A: "Bolshevik bastards..."
 JAP_SOV_Border_Conflict.5.B: "Imperialist idiots..."

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.1.t: "Contacts Provide Useful Information"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.1.d: "Earlier today, our contacts in the Soviet Union were able to smuggle the information that they had been collecting back to the Imperial General Headquarters. After being compared to recent reconnaissance from the Imperial Army, the information was proven valid. The provided locations of Soviet and Mongolian battalions and troop movements will help in the planning of upcoming military engagements with our Bolshevik enemies. Our contacts have returned to their assignments of sniffing out the enemy's secrets. We can only hope that the information they provide next will be as beneficial as it was this time."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.1.A: "Knowing is half the battle."

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.2.t: "Contacts Provide Outdated Information"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.2.d: "Earlier today, our contacts in the Soviet Union were able to smuggle the information that they had been collecting back to the Imperial General Headquarters. After being compared to recent reconnaissance from the Imperial Army, the information was determined to be outdated. Detailed descriptions of Soviet and Mongolian positions and troop movements had been observed over a week ago and had changed since that time. Our contacts have returned to the efforts of sniffing out the enemy's secrets. We can only hope that next time their information will be of more value to us."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.2.A: "A minor setback"

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.3.t: "Soviets Apprehend Our Contacts"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.3.d: "Our contacts in the Soviet Union have been apprehended by Soviet forces! While gathering information for our offensives, our contacts unfortunately caught the eye of Soviet counter intelligence. They were apparently unaware of the attention their acts of espionage were receiving and failed to escape capture by the Red Army. While we have others are still working to uncover the enemy's secrets, the capture of these men may force them to lie low until the Soviet's eyes turn elsewhere. Lost with our contacts is also the information they had been accumulating; a serious blow to our efforts."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.3.A: "Damn!"

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.4.t: "Soviet Resistance Crumbles"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.4.d: "Good news from the front lines! After a series of engagements with Soviet and Mongolian forces, our troops have pushed the enemy back with only a few losses. The retreating forces have crumbled before the might of our own forces and the troops have begun to celebrate. Reports from the battle have provided us with vast quantities of information and tactics for future engagements. The men who were lost today have provided the Imperial Army with valuable information that will benefit the Emperor and all of Japan."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.4.A: "A resounding victory!"

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.5.t: "Assault Stalls Out"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.5.d: "Our most recent attempts to dislodge the Soviet forces have ground to a standstill. Initial pushes were beginning to show signs of success, but Soviet counter-offensives have forced the battle into a stalemate. It seems unlikely that any further actions in the area will produce better results, and while valuable information was gained from the skirmishes, the large loss of men in this battle has left a bitter taste in the mouths of the soldiers. We must learn from this battle so that the next one will be a complete success."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.5.A: "We will surely succeed next time!"

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.6.t: "Soviets Rout Our Forces"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.6.d: "The most recent clash between the Imperial Army and Soviet forces has ended in complete disaster. The Soviets were quickly able to out-maneuver our troops and secure strong footholds to launch a devastating offensive that routed our forces. The remaining forces began retreating in an unorganized panic that only added to the casualties. There is nothing positive to note about this engagement. The loss of men and equipment is catastrophic and all of our current battle plans must be reconfigured to make sure such a loss does not happen again."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.6.A: "Someone will pay for this incompetence!"

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.7.t: "Manchurian Battalion Arrives"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.7.d: "New arrivals at the front lines today as an entire Manchurian battalion has been sent to aid us in our skirmishes with the Soviets and Mongolians. While not completely expected, the arrival of the battalion is a welcome surprise. Already, the Imperial Army has taken leadership of the battalion and has begun positioning them along the front lines to bolster our forces stationed there. Battle plans that seemed unfeasible due to the lack of troops we had available to us in the area are now being reviewed in earnest to see what plans provide us with the best chance of success."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.7.A: "A most pleasant development!"

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.8.t: "Manchurian Platoon Arrives"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.8.d: "New arrivals at the front lines today as a Manchurian platoon has arrived to help in our skirmishes against the Soviets and Mongolians. While there were hopes for more than a single platoon of support from Manchuria, our command is still able to work with the men they have been given. The platoon has been folded into the Imperial Army and will be repositioned to an area of need in the coming days. They will be well-versed in all of our battle doctrines so that they may be ready to assist in any situation."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.8.A: "Surely they can spare us more than this?"

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.9.t: "Manchurians Turn to Banditry"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.9.d: "We have recently discovered that the Manchurian forces sent to support us in our skirmishes against the Soviets and Mongolians have instead decided to turn to banditry! After arriving in our camps, they decided instead to leave and looted our supply lines on their way out, causing havoc and harming our efforts against the Soviets. The sudden loss of support from the Manchurians will no doubt give our enemies a numerical advantage in the area and will make any attempts at assaults in the immediate future impossible."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.9.A: "Worthless! Every one of them!"

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.10.t: "Successful Artillery Barrage"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.10.d: "Our recent artillery barrage against the Soviets has been a resounding success! The Soviets, unaware of the presence of heavy ordinance in the area, were caught completely by surprise when the first shells began to fall. Unable to muster a manageable defense against the barrage, the Soviets were forced to retreat with significant casualties. Already, our generals are attempting to see if we can replicate this success elsewhere along the border. The tactics used in this assault will surely benefit us in our future endeavors."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.10.A: "The superiority of the Imperial Army on full display."

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.11.t: "Ineffective Artillery Bombardment"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.11.d: "Our recent artillery bombardment of the Soviet lines has proven ineffective. Before our troops assaulted the enemy's lines, our artillery was to target key defensive structures to alleviate the threat to our troops. However, recent reconnaissance indicates that the strikes overall failed to hit the key structures necessary to make the assault succeed. The high winds made precision strikes difficult to achieve, and the cold weather negatively affected the trajectory and velocity of the ordinance. These factors combined during the operation and let the Soviet defensive installations survive with minimal damage. The bombardment has also alerted the enemy to our plans and they have now reinforced the area, making an assault implausible. For now, all we can do is bide our time until the opportunity to attack comes again."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.11.A: "Unfortunate."

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.12.t: "Harsh Weather Destroys Our Artillery"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.12.d: "A recent cold-snap and blizzard has destroyed some of our artillery pieces on the front lines. The cold, going beyond levels that were expected, permeated the body of the pieces and caused the metal to become brittle and the lubricants to freeze solid. Attempts to use the guns in their current state only led to the cracking of the metal supports and barrels. Our engineers have begun to salvage what they can from the equipment, but early estimates are not promising. While our artillery is out of action, the Soviets will be able to move their troops more freely without fear of an offensive from our troops. This will undoubtedly give them an advantage in the coming days."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.12.A: "We need those field guns!"

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.13.t: "Bandits Conduct Successful Sabotage"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.13.d: "With the equipment we provided them, it appears that the bandits were successful in sabotaging the Japanese war effort in the region. According to reports, the bandits severely damaged Japanese railroads and successfully intercepted numerous small Japanese logistic columns.\n\nThis will undoubtedly be of great assistance to our frontline effort against Japanese forces. They cannot fight against our superior forces unless sufficient reinforcements arrive on time, and given their army's lack of supplies, we may be able to easily overrun them."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.13.A: "Brilliant news!"

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.16.t: "Japanese Resistance Crumbles"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.16.d: "Our attack was a huge success, and the Japanese are fleeing for the hills! Because of our well-planned assault on the unprepared Japanese forward positions, they had no idea we had launched a full-scale assault until our tanks had broken deep into their lines and their resistance had completely crumbled!\n\nThere are now only a few lingering resistances in the region, which we will eliminate as soon as possible. This will almost certainly teach the Japanese a lesson and bring them closer to the bargaining table."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.16.A: "A great victory for the Red Army!"

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.17.t: "Assault Stalls Out"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.17.d: "Our assault on the Japanese has been stuttering, as we have been unable to breach their defences quickly enough before they can react. Now that more Japanese troops have arrived, we must declare this assault a failure; continuing the assault would be a waste of military resources. We must assess the situation, reorganise our troops, and plan a new offensive at a later time.\n\nHopefully, our next assault will be more successful than this stalled assault."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.17.A: "The Japanese are better than we think..."

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.18.t: "Japanese Rout Our Forces"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.18.d: "The attack has gone horribly wrong, and our troops have been routed by the Japanese forces! Not only did the assault fail because we did not break the enemy line, but the Japanese also counterattacked, shattering our forward element, completely disorganising our forces! We are now reorganising our remaining forces in order to hopefully stabilise the front line on our fallback position. This is a total disgrace for our army!\n\nThe Japanese will pay the price for this affront against us!"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.18.A: "A shameful display!"

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.19.t: "Mongolian Battalion Arrives"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.19.d: "The promised Mongolian reinforcement forces have arrived safely, bringing with them a full battalion of cavalry to aid us in our fight against the Japanese forces. It isn't much, but Mongolian forces don't have much to spare for this conflict in any case. At the very least, the cavalry battalion would be useful in future battles if we needed reconnaissance on Japanese positions and information on local terrain suitability for our forces."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.19.A: "A great addition to our forces."

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.20.t: "Mongolian Platoon Arrives"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.20.d: "The promised Mongolian forces have arrived, but their numbers appear to be greatly exaggerated: instead of a full battalion of men, only a platoon arrived at our position! This would be an awkward situation for both our diplomatic and military fronts, and the Mongolians would have to answer for it after the conflict was over. Still, this is better than nothing, and perhaps we can find a way to use them somehow in the future war effort against Japanese forces."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.20.A: "Damn it!"

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.21.t: "Mongolian Forces Desert"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.21.d: "We didn't expect much from the Mongolians, but this is a different story! Mongolian troops have deserted! The Mongolian forces' lack of discipline would be a major embarrassment for our diplomatic initiatives, as well as a minor setback to our overall war effort against the Japanese. To deal with the Japanese army, we will have to rely on our own forces. And filling the positions left vacant by the Mongolian army, the Japanese must be rejoicing at their temporary advantage..."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.21.A: "Cowards!"

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.22.t: "Successful Tank Offensive"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.22.d: "Today, our tank offensive made incredible progress! They have broken the Japanese line and crumbled their resistance, and are now driving deep into their rear lines, which we will simply clear out with our infantry to destroy the remaining fractured Japanese resistance that did not retreat. When this has been done, we will have won the battle in this region, which is likely to help tip the conflict in our favour. With more victories like this in the future, the Japanese will be forced to negotiate very soon."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.22.A: "A great victory!"

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.23.t: "Ineffective Tank Offensive"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.23.d: "Our tank offensive appears to be...unimpressive, to say the least. The assault has done significant damage to the Japanese, but has failed to break through the Japanese lines further. Without such a decisive victory, we will have to prolong the standoff and re-adjust our approach against the Japanese positions. Hopefully, our next offensives will be able to achieve a complete breakthrough against the Japanese forces and bring us victory in this minor conflict."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.23.A: "At least it wasn’t a bad attempt..."

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.24.t: "Harsh Freezes Out the Tanks"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.24.d: "We appear to have underestimated the climate in the far east; our tanks' lubricants and fuels are unprepared for the harsh weather and are now freezing. As a result, our tanks are now frozen in place before we have even begun preparing for an attack. We must cancel this operation, and we hope that our maintenance teams can salvage whatever is still reusable in these wreckages. Until further assistance arrives, we must hand over the initiative to the Japanese and wait for reinforcements."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.24.A: "Mother Nature works against us..."

 JAP_SOV_Turan_Incident.1.d: "Our forces near the Mongolian border village of Tauran have been defeated! After a fierce battle, with artillery bombardments and several cavalry charges, our forces were decimated by the enemy, and were forced to retreat with few soldiers alive, and no damage done to the invaders. This loss will most certainly take a toll on our army's morale, but we at least learned a thing or two when it comes to the modern battlefield."
 JAP_SOV_Turan_Incident.1.A: "Damn!"

 JAP_SOV_Turan_Incident.2.t: "Tauran Incident - Close Defeat"
 JAP_SOV_Turan_Incident.2.d: "The battle at Tauran has ended in a devastating defeat for our troops. Due to repeating charges and bombings, our armies withdrew quickly before circumstances became worse. Although, before leaving, we made sure to leave a mark in the enemy’s divisions. This may have not been a total defeat, but the several close calls to being one has put a damper on our army's morale. The men who died today did not perish in vain, however, as we now have more intel on what future wars and battles might look like."
 JAP_SOV_Turan_Incident.2.A: "We will recover."

 JAP_SOV_Turan_Incident.3.t: "Tauran Incident - Stalemate"
 JAP_SOV_Turan_Incident.3.d: "The battle at Tauran has come to a stalemate, as the enemy and our own troops didn’t move an inch. After repeating barrages and cavalry charges from both sides, Japanese and Soviet troops decided to call it a day and went back to the current border stances. This may have not been the best outcome, but it definitely could have been worse. Besides, our advisers present during the battle have picked up a few new ideas they want to try out."

 JAP_SOV_Turan_Incident.4.t: "Tauran Incident - Pyrrhic Victory"
 JAP_SOV_Turan_Incident.4.d: "Our forces near the Mongolian border village of Tauran won the battle, but at a great cost! After a day and night of cavalry charges and barrages from the enemy, we were able to overwhelm them, and they retreated! Many died because of the fierceness of the battle, but nonetheless, the surviving troops returned home with honour. Not only did we win, but our advisers present at the battle wrote down multiple new ideas we could potentially use in a future war."

 JAP_SOV_Turan_Incident.5.d: "Our forces near the Mongolian border village of Tauran won the battle in a strategic victory! Our forces launched one large ground assault on the enemy, and overwhelmed them in just a few hours! Many fine soldiers died, but nonetheless, the troops present celebrated the victory for those who couldn't. The advisers at the battle were also pleased with the victory, as the experience gained was priceless."

 JAP_SOV_Kanchazu_Incident.0.d: "“Sir! We have received intel that multiple Soviet motor boats have crossed the Amur River and unloaded troops on Kanchazu Island. We sent Manchurian officers to check the situation, only to be driven back by the same Soviet troops, but now it appears they are entrenched and building up defences! Due to an old 1860 agreement, the Soviets technically own the Amur Islands, but they've been in our possession much longer than the reds. Should we respond with an attack, or let them be?”"
 JAP_SOV_Kanchazu_Incident.0.A: "This isn't worth fighting over"

 JAP_SOV_Kanchazu_Incident.011.t: "Tensions Fall Over Kanchazu"
 JAP_SOV_Kanchazu_Incident.011.d: "With increasing tensions between the us and the Japanese, our border forces near the Amur River have occupied the Island of Kanchazu, as we have proof of ownership of the islands and others nearby. However, Manchurian police forces boated to the Island to check the situation, only to be driven back by our soldiers. This could have turned for the worst in a heartbeat, but the Japanese ambassador to the USSR, Shigemitsu Mamoru, has requested talks to keep the peace. The Japanese ambassador has stated that, although we own the islands, we are not in a position to push their claims further, so it’s best that a withdrawal begins to avoid further confrontation."
 JAP_SOV_Kanchazu_Incident.011.A: "It’s just an island, after all."

 JAP_SOV_Kanchazu_Incident.022.t: "Escalation at Kanchazu"
 JAP_SOV_Kanchazu_Incident.022.d: "It appears that taking a border island in Manchuria, which we legally own, has proven to anger the Japanese to a surprising level. After a small group of soldiers landed at Kanchazu, a Manchurian police force boated to the island to check on the situation. They were driven back by our troops, but they were clearly just protecting themselves. However, what could have been worked out with a simple conversation has turned into an approaching battle. The Japanese have seen it as a clear threat, and there’s been sightings of soldiers positioning artillery on the coast of the Amur river. With diplomacy out the window, we are expecting an attack at any time. We have instructed our troops on the island to begin building trenches and fortresses immediately."
 JAP_SOV_Kanchazu_Incident.022.A: "It seems a confrontation is unavoidable."

 JAP_SOV_Kanchazu_Incident.1.t: "Kanchazu Island Incident - Defeat"
 JAP_SOV_Kanchazu_Incident.1.d: "The border clash at Kanchazu island has resulted in a devastating defeat for us. Over the day and night, the enemy barraged our army with heavy artillery and bullets until it became clear it was a lost battle. The river made it impossible to charge with cavalry, and our own troops were scrambling to set up artillery that didn’t get bombed the second it was ready. Without a dent in the enemy, and a small amount of soldiers left, our army quickly retreated. The defeat significantly hindered our armies morale, but at least we learned a couple of things: Try not attacking near a river."
 JAP_SOV_Kanchazu_Incident.1.A: "Damn!"

 JAP_SOV_Kanchazu_Incident.2.t: "Kanchazu Island Incident - Close Defeat"
 JAP_SOV_Kanchazu_Incident.2.d: "The fighting was fierce and bitter, and the blood of our men spilled into the river, but the battle has ended in a grudging defeat. Shell after shell was shot over the river during day and night, and the sounds of machine guns filled the wilderness. The enemy lost many, but we lost just enough that if our troops continued, it would've ended in a total defeat. Wounded, but with the knowledge that they really did show their might, our armies retreated. They may have won, and our morale may be slightly wounded, but we at least know what to expect next time."
 JAP_SOV_Kanchazu_Incident.2.A: "They fought hard, and that’s enough."

 JAP_SOV_Kanchazu_Incident.3.t: "Kanchazu Island Incident - Stalemate"

Both sides fought valiantly, with grit and determination, but ultimately it was futile. Trenches and forts on the island made cavalry charges and artillery barrages useless, while on the coast, a form of guerrilla warfare did the same. Soon enough, the enemy stopped firing, and we called it a draw. Yes, nothing has changed, but our advisers have a few new tricks they want to try out after learning quite a bit at the battle."
 JAP_SOV_Kanchazu_Incident.3.A: "Well, we didn't lose."

 JAP_SOV_Kanchazu_Incident.4.t: "Kanchazu Island Incident - Pyrrhic Victory"
 JAP_SOV_Kanchazu_Incident.4.d: "The fighting was fierce and bitter, blood of our men spilled into the river, but when the guns on the other side went silent, our troops knew they'd won the battle! Shell after shell shot over the river over the night, and during the day, sounds of machine guns filled the wilderness. We lost many good men in the fight, but they lost more. Our soldiers are quite proud of their achievement, and our advisers at the battle wrote down a plethora of information for future battle tactics."
 JAP_SOV_Kanchazu_Incident.4.A: "A win is a win!"

 JAP_SOV_Kanchazu_Incident.5.t: "Kanchazu Island Incident - Victory"
 JAP_SOV_Kanchazu_Incident.5.d: "We stand victorious at Kanchazu! Our artillery pounded the enemy before they could even shoot a shell at us. A day of fighting resulted in the enemy retreating, and we took our rightful place at the border. We lost a fair amount of men, but the surviving troops celebrated the victory nonetheless. Not only did we win a decisive victory, but our advisers at the battle came back with pages upon pages of new strategic info that can be used in new strategies in future battles, adding more value to the win."
 JAP_SOV_Kanchazu_Incident.5.A: "Cheers to our boys in the field!"

 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.011.t: "Conflict at Lake Khasan"
 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.011.d.JAP: "Since the beginning of the twentieth century, we and the Russians have had an extremely low level of trust in each other, which has culminated in several incidents, most notably the Russo-Japanese War. The Russians built the Chinese Eastern Railway to help connect their far-eastern lands to China, and the southern branch, known as the South Manchuria Railway, is now safely under our control and that of our Manchurian government. As a result, we maintain a military presence in the region to ensure that the Soviets do not get any stupid ideas, though this has recently been reduced due to our war in China.\n\nToday, however, tensions between our two countries have reached a boiling point in the Khasan region. One of their generals defected last month, providing valuable information about the state of their armed forces following the recent purges. Despite their nation's propaganda, the truth is that their army is weak, and now would be an excellent time to strike the Khasan region. After being asked to withdraw their forces from the hills west of Lake Khasan, they refused and continued to reinforce the area.\n\nWe have now ordered a small number of Kwantung divisions to assault their positions in the hope of dealing a crushing blow to their evil Communist nation. With the Emperor's will on our side, we'll send those poor socialists fleeing for their lives! It's impossible that we'll lose to them..."
 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.011.d.SOV: "Since the beginning of the twentieth century, we and the Japanese have had an extremely low level of trust in each other, which has culminated in several incidents, most notably the Russo-Japanese War. The Chinese Eastern Railway was built by us Russians to help connect our far-eastern lands to China, and the southern branch, known as the South Manchuria Railway, is unfortunately under the control of the Japanese and their pesky Manchurian collaborators. As a result, we maintain a significant military presence in the region to ensure that our neighbours do not get any stupid ideas.\n\nToday, however, tensions between our two countries have reached a boiling point in the Khasan region. After we reinforced our border there with trenches and communication posts in response to a defection last month of one of our generals who gave the Japanese critical information about the state of our forces, they requested that we withdraw our forces from the hills west of Lake Khasan, which we, of course, refused.\n\nThis has resulted in a small number of Kwantung divisions assaulting our positions in the name of their pitiful empire. We are confident that our forces will chase the rabid imperialist dogs away, demonstrating the full might of the Red Army! If we were to lose, those in command would have some serious questions to answer..."

 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.1.t: "Lake Khasan Incident - Defeat"
 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.1.d: "Catastrophe! Disaster! Our losses have accumulated to the point where we have been pushed out of the hills near Lake Khasan after days of hard fighting. According to reports from the area, our forces were quickly repulsed after charging enemy positions. The sight of their friends being blown up by gunfire caused panic, causing any stability our frontline had to quickly crumble. This enabled the enemy to launch a devastating counterattack, sweeping past our defensive positions before digging themselves in once more. We were unable to retake the land we had lost after our men were routed, and all of our other attacks were unsuccessful.\n\nThis is a colossal failure. While this was primarily fought over a small area of land, and we would not have gained much if we had won, it does highlight our weaknesses in the field. Furthermore, once news reaches our nation's major cities, public morale may be shaken. For the time being, we must bury our dead, rethink our military strategy, and perhaps even downplay the magnitude of our defeat here."
 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.1.A: "Someone will answer for this mess!"

 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.2.t: "Lake Khasan Incident - Close Defeat"
 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.2.d: "Unfortunately, we learned today that our soldiers were beaten at Lake Khasan. While our forces were not completely destroyed, we were forced to retreat after days of hard fighting. According to officers fighting, we were on the defensive for the majority of the time there, and while things appeared to be going our way at first, the tide began to turn slowly as the enemy began to bring in more firepower to support their units.\n\nThis had a significant impact on the engagement, as we found ourselves conceding more and more ground in the latter stages of the fighting, to the point where we could no longer contest control of the hills near Lake Khasan.\n\nThere is no doubt that this is a disappointing outcome, but we must consider the positives. We were able to inflict significant casualties on the enemy, ensuring that they bled for every mile of land they took. Furthermore, the forces that survived have gained valuable combat experience, and we may see some new officers emerge from their ranks. For the time being, the defeat is bitter, but we will return stronger."
 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.2.A: "We must learn from our mistakes immediately."

 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.3.t: "Lake Khasan Incident - Stalemate"
 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.3.d: "After days of bitter and bloody fighting with enemy forces at Lake Khasan, a ceasefire has been declared, as neither we nor our adversary has gained enough ground to push each other back. This is not the desired outcome, but we will take it over being beaten and forced to retreat. Both sides' carefully planned assaults and defensive manoeuvres frequently meant that, while our offensives frequently resulted in heavy casualties, our positions on the hills allowed us to mount strong defences against their attacks.\n\nBecause neither side could make a breakthrough, our officers reached an agreement with the enemy to call a ceasefire. We should be proud of ourselves for holding off the enemy, even if there isn't much to show for it, and it's almost certain that our adversary will spin this story in their favour. However, the high command stated that it was a good experience for our soldiers, so that is one positive from this skirmish."
 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.3.A: "A bloody and tiring mess, all nothing."

 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.4.t: "Lake Khasan Incident - Pyrrhic Victory"
 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.4.d: "Good news has reached the capital today, as our forces defeated the enemy at Lake Khasan, albeit at a higher cost to our generals. The fighting was tough, and it appeared at first that we would not be able to breach the enemy lines, but with skillful assaults by our officers and some tactical blunders on the enemy's part, we were able to show great resilience and win the skirmish.\n\nThis is a good result, even though it took a lot of resources and men to achieve it. The enemy fought valiantly, but not effectively enough to halt our advance. The soldiers who fought there will have invaluable experience that they will use in future battles. We must now ensure that any errors in our planning are corrected. This is a victory, but we have paid dearly in blood."
 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.4.A: "A victory, but at what cost?"

 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.5.t: "Lake Khasan Incident - Victory"
 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.5.d: "Today, high command is celebrating our stunning victory over our adversaries at Lake Khasan! After the enemy launched a disastrous attack against our brave soldiers, we displayed a dominant display of our armed forces, remaining on top throughout the entire skirmish. Their frontline collapsed due to a significant drop in morale, and our boys, fueled by victory, launched a counterattack that sent them fleeing to the hills with their tails between their legs! Our flag was planted on the hills surrounding Lake Khasan to demonstrate that we have complete control of the area.\n\nThis victory will be celebrated at home, which will undoubtedly boost public morale. The soldiers who fought there deserve a medal or two for their bravery, and the experience they gained will be extremely valuable to their army careers. This victory demonstrates that our doctrine is correct, and we will undoubtedly benefit from it in our propaganda efforts."

 JAP_SOV_Khalkin_Gol_Incident.011.t: "Nomonhan Incident"
 JAP_SOV_Khalkin_Gol_Incident.011.d.JAP: "Since our invasion of Manchuria in 1931, we have eagerly been eyeing new territory, particularly in the Soviet Union, our northern neighbour. Because of this, we have engaged in numerous border skirmishes, with the battle at Lake Khasan being one of the more notable engagements with the Soviets. Now, we find ourselves at odds with them once more, this time near a town called Nomonhan and Khalkin Gol river, located within their ally Mongolia.\n\nWe have been fortifying the border there for some time with the help of the Kwantung Army, and it seems our efforts will have been worthwhile. A small Mongolian cavalry unit has been attacked by one of our Manchurian cavalry units, as they were clearly violating our borders, although the Mongolians say that they were merely letting their horses graze in the disputed area. That is clearly a bluff however, most likely to get a reaction from our troops. Well, they certainly have got a reaction, but one that will see them swiftly defeated and punished for their insolence!\n\nAll of this has led to a rapid build-up of forces from both sides in the area, and it seems that border conflict at Khalkin Gol is inevitable, with international observers stating that it could end up being a bloody stalemate. But, if one side does wins, they will certainly end up having much more influence over the area than the other."
 JAP_SOV_Khalkin_Gol_Incident.011.d.SOV: "Since the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931, they have been eagerly eyeing new territory in us, their northern neighbour. Because of this, we have engaged in numerous border skirmishes, with the battle at Lake Khasan being one of the more notable engagements with the Japanese. Now, we find ourselves at odds with them once more, this time over the Khalkin Gol river located within our brave ally Mongolia.\n\nAlong with the Mongolian army, we have been keeping a close eye on Japanese movement on the border, and we have noticed an increase in their fortifications recently. To see how far the Japanese would be willing to go, a small unit of Mongolian cavalry was sent to let their horses graze in the disputed area. It seemed like a harmless activity, but they were savagely attacked by Manchurian cavalry. We managed to get a reaction from them, but it seems they a preparing themselves for something more than we were expecting.\n\nAll of this has led to a rapid build-up of forces from both sides in the area, and it seems that border conflict at Khalkin Gol is inevitable, with international observers stating that it could end up being a bloody stalemate. But, if one side does wins, they will certainly end up having much more influence over the area than the other."

 JAP_SOV_Khalkin_Gol_Incident.1.t: "Battle of Khalkin Gol - Defeat"
 JAP_SOV_Khalkin_Gol_Incident.1.d: "In a complete disaster of our planning and preparation, our forces have been resoundingly defeated by the enemy! Our foes utilised their air support much better than we anticipated and combined with the skilled use of tanks meant that our forces were overwhelmed, with morale quickly plummeting after a series of small, but significant defeats.\n\nDespite launching a counterattack to try and repel enemy forces, it was our troops who found themselves being repelled instead after failing to capture any points of strategic importance, leaving our flanks open for one final enemy attack, which knocked us out of the battle altogether.\n\nNot only is this a humiliating defeat for our armed forces, but we have also left equipment behind such as tanks and trucks, all of which can be used by the enemy to identify weak points in our designs, which will surely help them should they ever engage in combat with us again."
 JAP_SOV_Khalkin_Gol_Incident.1.A: "I want a list of those in charge of this chaos now!"

 JAP_SOV_Khalkin_Gol_Incident.2.t: "Battle of Khalkin Gol - Close Defeat"
 JAP_SOV_Khalkin_Gol_Incident.2.d: "Disappointing reports from Khalkin Gol have been received by high command today which tell of our defeat to enemy forces. Despite putting up a strong fight against the enemy, and inflicting many losses on them, our troops have been unsuccessful in pushing back and securing victory. There were points in the battle when the fighting was going our way, but defeat came when the enemy launched an all or nothing assault against our lines, with the gamble paying off for them.\n\nWhile this is a sobering defeat, we must take pride in the fact that we managed to hold up the enemy advance for some time, prolonging the battle and increasing the casualties they took. Our forces that fought there have also gained good experience of fighting against a strong enemy, and some generals are already pointing out who might be the new commanders of the next generation. We have been knocked down for now, but we will rise once more."
 JAP_SOV_Khalkin_Gol_Incident.2.A: "An unfortunate set of circumstances."

 JAP_SOV_Khalkin_Gol_Incident.3.t: "Battle of Khalkin Gol - Stalemate"
 JAP_SOV_Khalkin_Gol_Incident.3.d: "Today, a ceasefire has been declared between us and our enemy as fighting at Khalkin Gol has turned into nothing more than a bloody mess, with no side able to gain an advantage over the other. The battle has been moving back and forth for several days, with one side gaining ground, only to be pushed back by a counterattack by the other. There were times where it seemed like we were about to make a crucial breakthrough, although it never managed to amount to anything significant enough to turn the tide in our favour.\n\nWith the ceasefire now in place, we will be able to recover our wounded and our dead, as well as any equipment that can be used again or turned into scrap. We should also try to portray this as a victory to our public somehow, as we are sure the enemy will do the same thing as well. Considering the situation however, we have identified several weaknesses within our doctrines, so we must now focus on improving and refining our combat tactics."
 JAP_SOV_Khalkin_Gol_Incident.3.A: "Mistakes were made, and lessons were learnt."

 JAP_SOV_Khalkin_Gol_Incident.4.t: "Battle of Khalkin Gol - Pyrrhic Victory"
 JAP_SOV_Khalkin_Gol_Incident.4.d: "We have been informed today by high command that we have managed to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat at Khalkin Gol after days of hard and bloody fighting. After sustaining heavy losses in the first phases of the battle, it seemed likely that we were going to be beaten. However, after a superb flanking manoeuvre by one of the commanders, we managed to take the enemy by surprise and cause disarray within their lines, and after that they could never recover.\n\nDespite the victory in battle however, it has come at a steep cost to our forces in the region. We lost large swathes of men in several failed offensives, alongside numerous amounts of tanks and planes. This shows that there are still various areas of our doctrine that we can improve on, and our generals are already identifying areas that require immediate attention. "
 JAP_SOV_Khalkin_Gol_Incident.4.A: "It’s a win... just."

Throughout the entire time our forces were there, they never looked as if they were going to be defeated, showing how dominant our army can be. With our use of tanks and infantry, supported by planes from above, we crushed enemy resistance and broke through their lines, inflicting heavy casualties on them. As the flag of our glorious nation was lifted over the battlefield, we began to collect our fallen, who will surely be remembered for their part in this stunning triumph.\n\nPublic morale has already been boosted, and there are plenty of medals to hand out to every soldier who took part. High command has stated that the doctrine used will be improved upon even more to strengthen our armed forces even more. This day shall long be remembered in the history of our nation!"

 JAP_SOV_Khalkin_Gol_Incident.6.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]International experts have been paying close attention to the Mongolian-Manchurian border in recent days, as heavy fighting between Soviet and Japanese forces has taken place near Khalkin Gol. Today, an official statement from the Empire of Japan has said that “Soviet forces have been repelled from rightful Japanese territory, and the interests of His Majesty Hirohito have been protected from the stain of Communism”. This battle marks a recent string of border skirmishes in the far east, many being both bloody and brutal.\n\nIt is reported that nearly 100,000 troops in total took part, with numerous amounts of tanks and planes to support waves of infantry battalions. Many outside observers questioned whether Japanese forces would be able to defeat the Soviet troops stationed in Mongolia, as the conflict with the Chinese still rages on with no signs of stopping. However, the Japanese have proved them wrong, and their generals are calling it a “stunning victory”, although some question if it was a crushing defeat of Soviet forces.\n\nThe Soviet Union is yet to speak, although it is thought that a blame game has begun on who is responsible for the defeat. Many are weary of the recent purges in the country, and no one wants to be on the wrong end of an apparently angry Stalin."

Since the end of the battle, a ceasefire has been declared between the two sides after they both found themselves in a bitter stalemate where neither side could find a decisive breakthrough. While both sides a trying to paint the battle in their favour, international experts say, “it is clear that there is no victor”.\n\nBoth nations went into the battle looking to win and exert more influence over the area than the other, but the gamble hasn’t paid off for either side, with thousands dead for no reason, as well as large amounts of equipment destroyed, such as tanks and planes. The tide of the battle turned in favour of each side numerous times, although neither army could use the momentum to win.\n\nThe two nations will now have time to reflect on what can be considered a disappointing end for both sides. For Japan, they will be wanting to improve their tactics for their current war in China as quick as possible, while for the Soviet Union, they will still be learning of new ways to move forward after the purges that removed many of their top generals."\n\nThe future of the far east looks as uncertain as ever.

 JAP_SOV_Khalkin_Gol_Incident.8.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Throughout the years, Japan and Russia have always been at odds, despite the change of ideologies in these nations. Today, the Soviet Union can finally claim victory over the Empire of Japan, with one Soviet official saying that “when the full might of the workers unite, the evil power of imperialism will crumble under the hammer and sickle, as we have shown to the world”. The end of the conflict at Khalkin Gol draws the curtain on one of the bloodiest border skirmishes the two nations have engaged in.\n\nWith an estimated 100,000 troops taking part in the battle, international experts had correctly predicted it to be the largest battle fought between the Soviet Union and Japan, with tanks and planes being utilised by both sides, although it was the Soviets who did this more effectively. While many claim it was the sheer amount of Russian troops that helped them win, Soviet high command insists it was their “superior tactics and planning” that secured them success.\n\nNo word has been heard from any Japanese officials, and it seems that they are trying to forget about the whole ordeal already and re-focus their efforts on China. For the Soviet Union however, the propaganda machine is already whirring again, and they will make sure that the whole world knows of their success."
