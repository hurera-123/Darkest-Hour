 EST_Soviet_Annexation.1.t: "Soviet Union Demands a Treaty!"
 EST_Soviet_Annexation.1.d: "The Soviet Union has come to us demanding a Treaty of Mutual Assistance between our two governments- it seems that developments to the west have caused Moscow to re-evaluate their strategic position. The treaty contains seven articles, of which 1, 3, and 5 are most significant.\n\nArticle 1 of the Soviets' desired treaty compels both nations to defend one another in case of an attack by a third power, certainly meaning Germany.\n\nArticle 3 grants the USSR the right to station troops in several military bases on Estonian soil.\n\nArticle 5 reaffirms that both nations will remain sovereign and retain their current governments.\n\nDespite Article 5's recognition of our nation's sovereignty, many in Tallinn feel that agreeing to the treaty and opening our borders to Russian troops would essentially be signing away our independence. At the very least, it would firmly commit us to the Soviet sphere of influence. In the end, however, if Moscow decides to take what they want by force, we are in no position to resist."
 EST_Soviet_Annexation.1.A: "There's no point in resisting, sign the treaty."
 EST_Soviet_Annexation.1.B: "If we must die for our freedom, so be it."

 EST_Soviet_Annexation.2.t: "Soviet–Estonian Mutual Assistance Treaty"
 EST_Soviet_Annexation.2.d: "After a week and a half of high tensions some small relief appears to have come to the growing Baltic Crisis. Today Foreign Ministers Molotov, and Selter signed a Mutual Assistance Treaty between The Soviet Union and The Estonian Republic.\n\nTensions Have been rising between both The Soviets and The Estonians over the course of months. With the signing of the Molotov Ribbentrop Pact and the beginning of The Invasion of Poland, many feared that with the western allies distracted now in the west no assistance would come to Estonia and other baltic nations. Now those fears have all come to pass, The Soviets have demanded the Estonian Government sign an intolerable treaty.\n\nThe Treaty includes many articles and provisions mainly aimed at mutual defense but most importantly the Treaty has given the Soviets the right to base troops in Estonian territory. This article worries many in The Estonian Public and government but the guarantees of sovereignty have alleviate this worry some what."
 EST_Soviet_Annexation.2.A: "Peace in our Time?"

 EST_Soviet_Annexation.3.t: "Soviet Union Demands a New Government!"
 EST_Soviet_Annexation.3.d: "We have received a notice from the Soviet ambassador, a notice that has been dreaded and inevitable. Since the Mutual Assistance treaty was forced upon us last year, it has been expected that the Bolsheviks would eventually try to subvert our independence, and it is now clear that is indeed occurring. Moscow is demanding an unspecified amount of Red Army soldiers be stationed in Estonia and a new communist government be installed, in effect, occupying our nation.\n\nAny chance at an effective resistance is a small one, with contacts in Lithuania and Latvia informing us of similar resolutions against them. While one could possibly hope for European intervention, it seems doubtful that the Western Allies would stick up for us, especially while Hitler continues to rampage around. Still, this is our independence we’re discussing, there will be no turning back from the brink."
 EST_Soviet_Annexation.3.A: "We stand no chance against the Red Tide, agree to Soviet demands."
 EST_Soviet_Annexation.3.B: "Defy the Reds, the Bolsheviks will bleed for Estonia!"

 EST_Soviet_Annexation.4.t: "Estonia Occupied"
 EST_Soviet_Annexation.4.d: "[ROOT.GetNewsIcon]\nThis morning, the world received an update from the front lines in the Baltics. The news: the Red Army has completely crushed the Estonians, and the occupation has begun. Local communists celebrate the news, while Estonian nationalists view this as the beginning of oppression by the Soviet government. Whatever the case, the Soviet Union has avenged the Estonian War of Independence and shown off the strength of its army. The Estonian government has gone into exile, and the Soviet Union has held a military parade in Tallinn to celebrate their victory and “another defeat for the capitalist oppressors”.\n\nMany nations have issued condemnations of the Soviet invasion and have announced their support for the Estonian government-in-exile, but the Soviet government in Moscow cares little for their opinion. After all, Estonia has entered the Soviet realm, and whether it will ever escape remains unclear. But it is certain that, at least for the next few years, the nation of Estonia is gone."
 EST_Soviet_Annexation.4.A: "Welcome to the Union"

 EST_Soviet_Annexation.5.t: "Formation of the People's Governmnet"
 EST_Soviet_Annexation.5.d: "Bowing to the power of the Bolshevik state, a pro-Soviet government has been formed in Tallinn. Headed by Andrey Zhdanov, the new socialist hierarchy will form the backbone of the revitalized Estonian state. The ultimatum also has allowed free movement of Soviet forces through her sovereign territory. While there are some protests by civilians in the capitol and Narva, so far, life for many Estonians has continued as usual.\n\nThe Red Army is expected to make it's move tomorrow, formally beginning our occupation."
 EST_Soviet_Annexation.5.A: "Welcome to the Motherland!"

 EST_Soviet_Annexation.6.t: "Elections for People's Riigikogu"
 EST_Soviet_Annexation.6.d: "[ROOT.GetNewsIcon]\nA Soviet-backed party in a Soviet-backed government is only a step closer to full Soviet annexation. With the recent parliamentary election in our country, the communists have taken power, but the reactionaries in our nation claim this was through unconstitutional means. Much like our Baltic sisters, we had been staunch supporters of republicanism since our nation’s founding, but this seemingly unfair election has had quite the toll on Estonia’s future. Many conservatives’ fears have been realized with the total control the communist party holds over the parliament, and this new “People’s Riigikogu” is controlled by those who want to achieve closer and closer ties with the USSR.\n\nEven before the voting ended, Soviet troops had occupied the countryside and the cities, harassing and arresting any dissenters who opposed a Workers’ Estonia. It is certain that closer and closer relations will be established between our government and the Soviets; moreover, the Workers’ People’s Union has claimed that allying to the USSR gives us protection against the expansionist Germans, a sign of friendship between Moscow and Tallinn. However, many fear that “friendship” will lead to a Russian dominated Estonia, the very same system we broke away from in 1918. To make the situation worse for those calling for independence, many within the People’s Riigikogu are calling for immediate annexation into the USSR. The results of a 100% communist parliament are sure to vote in favor of one choice - the birth of a quite close friendship, almost too close."
 EST_Soviet_Annexation.6.A: "The birth of a new friendship indeed."

 EST_Soviet_Annexation.7.t: "Establishment of Estonian SSR"
 EST_Soviet_Annexation.7.d: "Election results are being tallied all around Estonia, from the urban areas to the rural zones. Unsurprisingly, since they were the one and only party with a list of candidates on the ballots, the “Union of the Estonian Working People” is expected to win in a sweeping victory. The Republic will be rebranded as the Estonian SSR, in a nod to Moscow’s overwhelming authority. Already, Red Army soldiers are scouting areas in Tallinn for local socialist monuments, and there is a rumour of a petition being prepared in regards to Estonia formally joining the Soviet Union.\n\nRegardless of what is to occur, the nation's future is now tied directly to the USSR, for better or for worse."
 EST_Soviet_Annexation.7.A: "Reap, sickle, and beat out, hammer!"

 EST_Soviet_Annexation.8.t: "Estonian SSR requests to join the Union"
 EST_Soviet_Annexation.8.d: "We have received a telegram from Tallinn requesting a formal integration process to begin, allowing the Estonian SSR to join our glorious Soviet Republic. While this has been a goal of ours since the division of Poland, it was desired to have the Estonians ask us for permission, rather than the opposite. Even slight appearances can have drastic consequences.\n\nWith the Western Allies too busy focused on the Führer to interfere, now begins the process of Sovietization of Estonia. The People’s Parliament shall help us craft the laws and begin the nationalization of certain heavy industries. Redistribution of wealth and property will be slowly introduced. Any complaints by the people will be, of course, duly noted."
 EST_Soviet_Annexation.8.A: "Welcome, Comrades! We have borscht!"

 LAT_Soviet_Annexation.1.t: "Soviet Union Demands a Treaty!"

 LAT_Soviet_Annexation.2.t: "Soviet–Latvian Mutual Assistance Treaty"
 LAT_Soviet_Annexation.2.d: "After weeks of high tensions some small relief appears to have come to the growing Baltic Crisis. Today Foreign Ministers Molotov, and Munters signed a Mutual Assistance Treaty between The Soviet Union and The Latvian Republic.\n\nTensions Have been rising between both The Soviets and The Latvians over the course of months. With the signing of the Molotov Ribbentrop Pact and the beginning of The Invasion of Poland, many feared that with the western allies distracted now in the west no assistance would come to Estonia and other baltic nations. Now those fears have all come to pass, The Soviets have demanded the Latvianian Government sign an intolerable treaty.\n\nThe Treaty includes many articles and provisions mainly aimed at mutual defense but most importantly the Treaty has given the Soviets the right to base troops in Estonian territory. This article worries many in The Latvian Public and government but the guarantees of sovereignty have alleviate this worry some what."
 LAT_Soviet_Annexation.2.A: "Peace with Honour?"

 LAT_Soviet_Annexation.3.t: "Soviet Union Demands a New Government!"
 LAT_Soviet_Annexation.3.d: "News from the East!\n\nFollowing our recent treaty agreements with the USSR, they have stepped up their demands, and are awaiting our response.\n\nMoscow has demanded that we establish a new Parliament headed by the communist party in our country. This is an egregious request, as we have held up the ideals of a fair republic since 1918, and we should not have to bend over to Russian bullies.\n\nHowever, many in our current government fear that refusing the Soviet’s demand is an act of suicide. They claim that we will be occupied by the Red Army in one way or another, and that accepting these demands will just make life easier and result in fewer Latvian deaths.\n\nWhatever the resolution, our decisions have costed us, and our independence from Bolshevism is waning."
 LAT_Soviet_Annexation.3.A: "We stand no chance against the Red Tide, agree to Soviet demands."
 LAT_Soviet_Annexation.3.B: "Defy the Reds, the Bolsheviks will bleed for Latvia!"

 LAT_Soviet_Annexation.4.t: "Latvia Occupied"
 LAT_Soviet_Annexation.4.d: "[ROOT.GetNewsIcon]\nToday, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics successfully occupied the Republic of Latvia. After the Red Army established themselves in Lithuania not long ago, they were provided with the perfect launching pad for a successful invasion of the Baltic nation. However, hoping to avoid bloodshed, the Soviets delivered an ultimatum to the Latvian government. They stated that in order to prevent an encounter on the battlefield the Latvians must first, set up a pro-Soviet government under the protection of the Red Army, and second, allow said Red Army to prowl the country with impunity.\n\nWishing to spare themselves the pain and suffering, the Latvian government accepted these terms and surrendered. Only a day later, the Soviets seized control of the telegraphs, telephones, and broadcasting offices, giving them a direct line to the Latvian people. Then, Andrey Vyshinsky, the Deputy Chairman of the Council's People's Commissars, arrived on behalf of the Soviet government, paying a visit to Kārlis Ulmanis, the now former President, effectively demonstrating the Soviet domination of Latvian politics.\n\nThe future of the Latvian nation and its people is as unclear as ever, and how the Soviet Union will decide to treat its new territory remains to be seen. However, considering the internal conflict, struggles and reported purges within the Union, it is unlikely that the Latvians will receive much different treatment."
 LAT_Soviet_Annexation.4.A: "Best wishes."

 LAT_Soviet_Annexation.5.t: "Formation of Pro-Soviet Government"
 LAT_Soviet_Annexation.5.d: "The Right and Center are in agony, and the Left reigns victorious.\n\nFollowing the recent treaty and subsequent establishment of a Pro-Soviet government.The Communist Party of Latvia, now known as the Working People’s Bloc, exercises control over the state.Many conservatives and centrists are outraged over the coming elections, which will undoubtedly be incredibly one-sided, yet Red troops guard the Parliament building, unyielding in the face of these protests. Other parties in parliament are still allowed to operate, but many fear that the Red Army will, in the coming days, cease their activities and arrest any dissenters and political opponents to a Red Latvia.\n\nThe next few days will ultimately uncover the fate of Latvia, but many have already lost hope and are preparing for the eventual annexation into the USSR."
 LAT_Soviet_Annexation.5.A: "The opponents to a Red Latvia are those who love Germany more."

 LAT_Soviet_Annexation.6.t: "Elections for People's Seimas"
 LAT_Soviet_Annexation.6.d: "[ROOT.GetNewsIcon]\nA Soviet-backed party in a Soviet-backed government is only a step closer to full Soviet annexation.

 LAT_Soviet_Annexation.7.t: "Establishment of a Latvian SSR"
 LAT_Soviet_Annexation.7.d: "An independent Latvia is no more. The Republic is dead, and the Soviets reign victorious.\n\nEarlier today, the Working People’s Bloc set into motion legislation to officially establish a Soviet Socialist Republic. Any doubt that the party was in full collaboration with the USSR, and that the intended outcome was full annexation into the Union has been extinguished. Soviet sympathisers praise this move, but many on the right and center are fleeing Latvia for a better life in their eyes. However, with recent events in Estonia and Lithuania regarding Soviet occupations as well, the Scandinavian states and even Germany will be their best options.\n\nAt this stage, Latvia still holds a shred of independence, but the Peoples Seimas has already drafted legislation to let go of that sliver of freedom, and officially join the USSR as a fellow Soviet Socialist Republic."
 LAT_Soviet_Annexation.7.A: "Twenty-two years just to be under Russian rule once more."

 LAT_Soviet_Annexation.8.t: "Latvian SSR requests to join the Union"
 LAT_Soviet_Annexation.8.d: "Following our recent occupation and Stalinist coup of Latvia, they have come to use with an offer that we surely couldn’t refuse. The Latvian SSR has given us the opportunity to formally annex them into the USSR, declaring them a sister republic within the Union.\n\nOf course, this offer only makes sense; Communist brethren must stick together in the face of Kraut expansionism and imperialism. They were misguided in 1918 and the subsequent bids for independence in the face of the evil White army and the Red Army. Thus, they have finally come to their senses and are willing to join a Republic that values them, unlike a Russian dominated state or a Tsardom.\n\nWith our troops already occupying the cities and countryside, it should be easy to put down any dissenters to their collaboration within the USSR, and we will make sure to protect them in case the Germans come knocking."
 LAT_Soviet_Annexation.8.A: "Let us graciously welcome them in"

 LIT_Soviet_Annexation.1.t: "Soviet Union Demands a Treaty!"
 LIT_Soviet_Annexation.1.d: "The Soviet Union has come to us demanding a Treaty of Mutual Assistance between our two governments- and they're offering us our official capital, Vilnius, occupied by Poland since 1920. The treaty contains nine articles, of which 1, 2, 4, and 7 are most significant.\n\nArticle 1 transfers the region of Vilnius to our ownership, returning the old capital to Lithuanian hands.\n\nArticle 2 of the Soviets' desired treaty compels both nations to defend one another in case of an attack by a third power, certainly meaning Germany.\n\nArticle 4 grants the USSR the right to station troops in several military bases on Lithuanian soil.\n\nArticle 7 reaffirms that both nations will remain sovereign and retain their current governments.\n\nDespite Article 5's recognition of our nation's sovereignty, many in Kaunas feel that agreeing to the treaty and opening our borders to Russian troops would essentially be signing away our independence. At the very least, it would firmly commit us to the Soviet sphere of influence. In the end, however, if Moscow decides to take what they want by force, we are in no position to resist."
 LIT_Soviet_Annexation.1.A: "Vilnius is worth the Soviet presence, sign the treaty."
 LIT_Soviet_Annexation.1.B: "Vilnius isn't worth our freedom."

 Baltic_Ultimatum: "Baltic Basing Rights"

 LIT_Soviet_Annexation.2.t: "Soviet–Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty"
 LIT_Soviet_Annexation.2.d: "The Papers in both Moscow and Lithuania today were filled with victorious news. The long negotiated Treaty of Mutual Assistance was signed in Moscow by Foreign Ministers Molotov and Urbšys. In Moscow it is being hailed as another victory of the workers in the overthrow of capitalism as Soviet troops move into Lithuania for its protection. Meanwhile in Lithuania the treaty is being hailed as a victory since in return for the basing of these Soviet units Lithuania will be returned its historical capital of Vilnius along with other lost territories that the Russians have recently captured in Poland.\n\nSince the Soviet-Polish War and neither the Soviets or the Lithuanians have been satisfied with their borders with Poland. The recent invasion of Poland has provided now the perfect opportunity to redraw this border for a more mutually beneficial state. Lithuania will be receiving almost all the lost territory in the Vilnius region along with the Soviets cedeing large areas of Lithuanian Majority.\n\nAlthough quite popular publicly, the treaty has sewn much discontent amongst the lithuanian public, especially amongst nationalist groups. The words “Vilnius is ours, but Lithuania is Russia’s” are heard onn far too many mouths for the governments comfort. In spite of this large numbers of celebrations have been planned for the handover days of the territories."
 LIT_Soviet_Annexation.2.A: "Please Clap!?"

 LIT_Soviet_Annexation.3.t: "Soviet Union Demands a New Government!"
 LIT_Soviet_Annexation.3.d: "It is astonishing that Lithuania has managed to retain its independence from the red menace to its East for so long. In 1918, Lithuania had barely managed to escape the Bolshevik grasp, but much time had passed since then, and now the Reds have come to reclaim what they have always considered theirs: the Baltics. The Soviet ambassador has presented the Lithuanian government with a list of outrageous demands for the establishment of a new administration on Lithuanian soil. No doubt, these demands will simply be the start of the USSR’s tightening grip.\n\nNo matter how much President Smetona will want to bury his head in the sand and ignore this difficult situation, a decision that will decide the fate of the nation needs to be made. He can either steel his resolve and prepare the country for war by refusing these ridiculous demands, or he can preserve the lives of his people and prevent bloodshed by submitting the nation to the whims of the Soviet Union. Both are dim prospects, but time is running out, and a decision needs to be made."
 LIT_Soviet_Annexation.3.A: "Give in to their demands. We have no choice."
 LIT_Soviet_Annexation.3.B: "Nonsense! We beat them once, we can do it again!"

 LIT_Soviet_Annexation.4.t: "Smetona flees, Merkys complies with the ultimatum"
 LIT_Soviet_Annexation.4.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Things are going as expected in Lithuania. Antanas Smetona has resigned from the Presidency, and cowardly fled the country with his family. According to our intelligence reports, the disgraced ex-president plans to form a government in exile on the German Reich, confirming our suspicions about his fascist sympathies. Smetona passed his presidential duties to Prime Minister Antanas Merky, who has been far more helpful.\n\nMerky has complied with the ultimatum to allow the integration of Lithuania and the Soviet Union. He also issued arrest warrants on reactionary officers and appointed our candidate for Prime Minister, Justas Paleckis. However, Merky is only an asset for the liberation of the Lithuanian workers, and he will resign in a few hours in favor of Paleckis. Lithuania will rejoin his Eastern brothers very soon."
 LIT_Soviet_Annexation.4.A: "A victory for the Lithuanian workers!"

 LIT_Soviet_Annexation.5.t: "Formation of the People's Governmnet"
 LIT_Soviet_Annexation.5.d: "The reactionary Lithuanian government has outlived its usefulness. With the resignation of Prime Minister Merkys and the coward Smetona fleeing the country, a new People's Government will now rule the country. Comrade Vladimir Dekanozov is now in the process of recruiting men loyal to our cause in order to fill a new cabinet. At the head of this cabinet will be a new Prime Minister, leftist journalist Justas Paleckis. There are doubts about his allegiance to the revolution, but he is sure to be more reliable than the Trotskist deviants that call themselves the Lithuanian Communist Party. However, we shouldn't need to worry for long, as Paleckis' government will prove to be only a transitional period as we work to incorporate Lithuania into the Union.\n\nAll these years of reactionary propaganda have fooled the Lithuanian people, and so the new government will need to assure them that we'll protect their independence and keep their best interests at heart. Along with the reversal of this reactionary indoctrination, the Seimas will need to be disbanded, political prisoners must be released, and reform must be pursued in the education and healthcare sectors. \n\nUnfortunately, foreign observers have declared that this change of government violates the Lithuanian constitution. But they can complain all they want: Lithuania will soon join his working-class brothers in the Union."
 LIT_Soviet_Annexation.5.A: "We are almost there."

 LIT_Soviet_Annexation.6.t: "Elections for People's Seimas"
 LIT_Soviet_Annexation.6.d: "[ROOT.GetNewsIcon]\nAnd the results are in.\n\nFollowing the recent establishment of the People’s Government earlier this year, and the re-emergence of the Lithuanian Communist party, the next step for relations with the Soviets was naturally a Lithuanian parliament dominated by communists. The Seimas had been the cornerstone of our republicanism since our nation’s founding, but now many conservatives’ fears have been realized with the total control the communist party holds over the People’s Seimas and the government as a whole. Even before the voting ended, Soviet troops had occupied the countryside and the cities, harassing and arresting any dissenters who opposed a Workers’ Lithuania. It is certain that closer and closer relations will be established between our government and the USSR, and many are even calling for total annexation. They have claimed that the USSR granting us Vilnius was a sign of friendship and determination for further cooperation, but many fear that this “friendship” will lead to a Russian dominated Lithuania, the very same system we broke away from in 1918."
 LIT_Soviet_Annexation.6.A: "The People’s Seimas shall cast its judgment."

 LIT_Soviet_Annexation.7.t: "Establishment of Lithuanian SSR"
 LIT_Soviet_Annexation.7.d: "Following their nearly unopposed victory in the first elections to the People's Parliament, the newly legalized Lithuanian Communist Party has announced the creation of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic.\n\nDeputy Chief of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs Vladimir Georgievich Dekanozov has been tasked with ensuring the nation's compliance with the Soviet's demands, taking a leading role in establishing a new government on the model of the Soviet party-state.\n\nWhile Lithuania remains nominally independent, the Red Army has supplanted the local armed forces, and opposition leaders have made a habit of disappearing into the vast Siberian wastes."
 LIT_Soviet_Annexation.7.A: "“Neither Nests Nor Sentinels, Only the Rustling of Young Birch Trees...”"

 LIT_Soviet_Annexation.8.t: "Lithuanian SSR requests to join the Union"
 LIT_Soviet_Annexation.8.d: "Separated from their Russian brothers, the Lithuanian workers have been under the yoke of the reactionary elite for too long. This injustice has ended today, as the new administration of the Lithuanian SSR notified us earlier today of their intention of joining our glorious union. A Lithuanian delegation of notable public figures traveled to Moscow, signing an official document ratifying the integration of Lithuania into the Soviet Union. \n\nLithuania's old oppressors tried to break the will of their workers and exploit them, but with our assistance, the common Lithuanian man rose from his shackles, and fought for what he desired. This is how it should be."
